	<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
	
	<p>Each term we collect information for a pupil’s attendance during the previous term. This may include information for pupils who left the school prior to census day.</p>
	
	<p>This should include information on pupils who were:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>aged between 4 and 15 as at 2017-08-31(autumn census)</li>
	<li>aged 4 to 15 as at 2018-08-31 (spring and summer censuses)</li>
	<li>on the school roll for at least one session during the specified term</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Attendance data is only required for non-boarder pupils (where pupil boarder indicator is equal to ‘N’).</p>
	
	<p>It is essential that schools return absence data correctly in the school census as we publish this data through the school absence national statistics releases.</p>
	
	<h3 id="collection-periods">Collection periods</h3>
	
	<p>The period covered by the termly attendance module is from the start of the autumn term (from 1 August) up to, and including, the Sunday before the late spring bank holiday.</p>

	</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<h3 id="data-required">Data required</h3>
	
	<p>For each pupil, we need the aggregate number of possible attendance sessions and the actual number of absences (by reason) for each attendance period.</p>
	
	<p>For schools that use the electronic registration module on their MIS, the census extracts the relevant data for each pupil for each attendance period (term or half term).</p>
	
	<p>Schools who use a registration system that is not integrated with their main MIS (or record attendances in paper registers) need to extract the data for each pupil included in the census and manually add this data to the census return.</p>
	
	<p>In this case, absence reporting by reason is not required and schools report on the number of authorised and unauthorised absences for each pupil. Schools should seek advice from the supplier of their main MIS on how to add data manually for the census return.</p>
	
	<h3 id="dual-registered-pupils">Dual registered pupils</h3>
	
	<p>Validation is in place to avoid the double counting of attendance and absence for pupils who are registered at more than one school (referred to as ‘dual registered’).</p>
	
	<p>Each school should:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>record the attendance and absence for the sessions the pupil is required to attend at their school</li>
	<li>use code ‘D’ (dual registered at another educational establishment) to record all of the sessions that the pupil is due to attend at the other school</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>We do not collect attendance code ‘D’ in the school census, as it is not counted as a possible session.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupils-unable-to-attend-school-due-to-exceptional-circumstances--code-y">Pupils unable to attend school due to exceptional circumstances – code ‘Y’</h3>
	
	<p>We collect attendance code ‘Y’ (unable to attend due to exceptional circumstances - not counted in possible attendances) in the school census but it is not counted as part of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<p>Schools should use code ‘Y’ to record the sessions where a pupil is unable to attend because:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the school site, or part of it, is closed due to an unavoidable cause</li>
	<li>the transport provided by the school or a local authority is not available and their home is not within walking distance</li>
	<li>a local or national emergency has resulted in widespread disruption to travel which has prevented the pupil from attending school</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="persistent-absence-methodology">Persistent absence methodology</h3>
	
	<p>Schools are judged against a persistent absence rate of 10% and pupils are identified as persistently absent based upon their individual absence level.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>If a pupil’s individual overall absence rate is greater than or equal to 10% they will be classified as a persistent absentee:
	[A pupil’s individual overall absence divided by a pupil’s individual possible sessions] multiplied by 100 must be greater than or equal to 10%.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-possible">Sessions possible</h3>
	
	<p>This records the number of sessions possible for the attendance period (term or half term). There are 2 sessions for each school day (morning and afternoon).</p>
	
	<p>Every pupil aged 4 to 15 (excluding boarders) at the previous 31 August who was on the school roll for at least one session during the specified attendance period (term or half term) should have an entry for the number of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<p>Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, manually calculate and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h4 id="dually-registered-pupils">Dually registered pupils</h4>
	
	<p>The sessions possible for a dual registered pupil submitted by the main school do not include those sessions where the pupil attends the subsidiary school. Similarly, the sessions possible for a dual registered pupil submitted by the subsidiary school do not include those sessions where the pupil attends the main school.</p>
	
	<h4 id="zero-sessions-possible">Zero sessions possible</h4>
	
	<p>Zero sessions possible are recorded where a dual registered pupil has all of their previous attendance (term or half term) for which attendance data is collected at the other registration.</p>
	
	<p>For example, where a dually registered pupil has all of the attendance at his / her subsidiary registration, the main registration would have zero sessions possible recorded for that period in the census.</p>
	
	<h4 id="summer-half-term">Summer half term</h4>
	
	<p>Study leave should be used sparingly and only granted to year 11 pupils during public examinations. As study leave is unsupervised, schools must record it as an authorised absence. Study leave is no longer applicable once examinations are concluded.</p>
	
	<p>The official school leaving date is the last Friday in June of the school year in which a child reaches age 16. This means that year 11 pupils must remain on the school roll until Friday 28 June 2019 and you must record their attendance to this date.</p>
	
	<p>Where pupils were born on or after 1999-09-01, they must remain in some form of education or training until their 18th birthday.</p>
	
	<p>Attendance data for the second half of the summer term in respect of pupils aged 15 years old is not published in any national statistics.</p>
	
	<h4 id="pupils-aged-4-years">Pupils aged 4 years</h4>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, the recorded number of sessions possible are those they are expected to attend and will vary from pupil to pupil and from school to school.</p>
	
	<p>Attendance code ‘X’ (non-compulsory school age absence - not counted in possible attendances) is used for sessions when a 4-year-old is not expected to attend, for example those attending part-time.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-authorised-absence">Sessions missed due to authorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Authorised absence is an absence that has been authorised by a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes where a parent has provided a satisfactory explanation, for example, illness.</p>
	
	<p>Schools can retrospectively authorise an absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-unauthorised-absence">Sessions missed due to unauthorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Unauthorised absence is an absence without permission from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences; for example, arriving late for school after the register has closed.</p>
	
	<p>It does not apply to pupils of non-compulsory school age (those aged 4 years).</p>
	
	<h4 id="pupil-absence-and-attendance-codes">Pupil absence and attendance codes</h4>
	
	<p>This relates to authorised or unauthorised absences for the pupil. Schools will be aware of the full range of absence and attendance codes, which include values for attendance and for approved education activities, as these codes are used by schools MIS when recording pupil attendance.</p>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, schools are not obliged to use individual absence and attendance codes. If schools do not wish to use these codes, then they should just provide the total number of absences for the attendance period by recording these as sessions missed due to authorised absence. Absences recorded for 4-year-olds will not be treated as ‘authorised’ or ‘unauthorised’ and instead will be reported, and published, as overall absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="number-of-sessions-missed">Number of sessions missed</h3>
	
	<p>The number of sessions missed for each specified reason for absence. Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, will manually calculate the number of session missed and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h2 id="exclusions">Exclusions</h2>
	
	<p>The module is collected in the census for all types of exclusions that occurred in the 2 previous terms. We collect:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>autumn term exclusion data in the following summer census</li>
	<li>spring term exclusion data in the following autumn census</li>
	<li>summer term exclusion data in the following spring census</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>We don’t count exclusions that have been overturned in national statistics.</p>
	
	<p>All items in the pupil identifiers module (except preferred surname) are collected for those pupils no longer on roll but for whom the exclusions module is collected.</p>
	
	<p>Schools must ensure that the exclusion appeal result is maintained on an event driven basis so that overturned exclusions can automatically be filtered out when data is extracted for the census.</p>

	<h3 id="exclusion-start-date">Exclusion start date</h3>
	
	<p>The exclusion start date reflects the date that the head teacher asked the pupil to leave the school. By not collecting the data until 2 terms after that in which the exclusion started, we expect you to have completed all appeals procedures by the time of the return, so only exclusions that have been upheld will be included.</p>
	
	<h3 id="actual-number-of-sessions-excluded-from">Actual number of sessions excluded from</h3>
	
	<p>For each fixed period and lunchtime exclusion, you should record the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect.</p>
	
	<p>For fixed period exclusions, each full school day counts as 2 sessions - a half school day counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>Where a fixed period exclusion is for a lunchtime, each lunchtime for which the exclusion applies counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>You should count exclusions that go across 2 census collection periods as 1 exclusion in the first collection period.</p>
	
	<p>Exclusion sessions only cover the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school. A fixed period exclusion can be discontinuous which means that there can be days between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for the day(s) they attending the other organisation.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil is excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Monday. However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday – where no exclusion is in place. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The other provider would record the pupil’s attendance on the Wednesday separately.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>For the sessions where the school have agreed that the pupil is not attending, you should record these as ‘authorised absence’ and not record the pupil as excluded for these sessions.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded for 8 sessions starting on a Tuesday. However, the pupil already has authorised absence for Friday and Monday afternoons. This means the pupil is excluded for all sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, as well as the morning sessions on Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>You should not record exclusions sessions for the day(s) when the pupil is attending an approved educational activity.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which they are not excluded. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Wednesday, Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Days on which there is a planned school closure do not count towards an exclusion.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for 4 sessions starting on a Friday, but the school plans to be closed on the Monday for an INSET day. This means the pupil’s exclusion will include 2 sessions on the following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="sen-provision-at-the-time-of-the-exclusion">SEN provision at the time of the exclusion</h3>
	
	<p>For each exclusion record returned, the SEN provision at the time of the exclusion must be included:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>‘E’ (education, health and care plan)</li>
	<li>‘K’ (SEN support)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="permanent-exclusions-and-school-leaving-date">Permanent exclusions and school leaving date</h3>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is permanently excluded, the school leaving date cannot be the same as the date of the permanent exclusion – unless the parent confirms that no appeal is to be made. You must allow time for the appeals process.</p>
	
	<p>You should only enter a school leaving date once the appeals process has concluded.</p>
	
	<h2 id="home-information">Home information</h2>
	
	<p>We only collect this information if the ‘pupil address type’ is ‘C’ (current).</p>
	
	<p>Schools can provide the department with their addresses in the format their MIS holds the data:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>BS7666 address format</li>
	<li>SAON, PAON, post town or other address item</li>
	<li>address line 1 to 5</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Every format requires a postcode.</p>
	
	<p>We expect schools to provide a valid home address for most of their pupils (including boarding pupils).</p>
	
	<p>You should record boarding pupils from abroad using their ‘home’ address as their residence during term time, which may be the school’s address.</p>
	
	<p>If a child has multiple addresses (where the child lives with both parents at different stages of the week) you should supply both addresses.</p>
	
	<p>If it is possible to get the address, you should leave these fields blank or add a partial address and ignore the validation errors.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unique-property-reference-number">Unique property reference number</h3>
	
	<p>A unique property reference number (UPRN) is a unique integer identifier for every address in Great Britain.</p>
	
	<p>The UPRN is a voluntary data item which you may choose to return alongside the full address (in either BS7666 or address line structure).</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect schools to collect, or look up, the UPRN and instead this will be automatically populated within your school system when entering addresses if the OS AddressBase database is used as a reference.</p>
	
	<h2 id="post-16-learning-aims-used-for-funding">Post-16 learning aims [used for funding]</h2>
	
	<p>Secondary schools with sixth forms, all-through schools, pupil referral units, city technology colleges and academies (including free schools) must return this data. ESFA uses this data to calculate funding allocations.
	Students at other schools (such as special schools or middle-deemed secondary schools) may undertake learning aims, but we do not collect this data as part of the school census.</p>
	
	<p>For information on which students are eligible for 16 to 19 funding, see the ESFA’s <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision">funding regulations guidance</a>.</p>

	
	<p>Schools must only include data for students who have (or had at the time of the learning aims) current or main registration at the school.</p>
	
	<p>For dual registered students, the school that holds the student’s main registration must return the data.</p>

	<h3 id="re-sits-and-re-takes">Re-sits and re-takes</h3>
	
	<p>A re-sit is when a student takes an exam again but does not attend regular lessons for the course (they may attend revision classes). We do not collect this data as part of the school census.</p>
	
	<p>A re-take is when a student is retaking a complete qualification, including attendance at regular classes. You should record this as a new learning aim.</p>
	
	<p>You should not include this in the planned hours unless:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the student is re-taking the qualification because of exceptional circumstances outside either the student’s or school’s control</li>
	<li>the student is doing a mandatory re-take of Maths and English GCSE</li>

	<p>You should return all learning aims in the autumn school census, which have been active at any point between 2018-08-01 and the autumn census day.</p>
	
	<p>If a student moves between year groups during the course of an academic year, it may not be possible for a school’s MIS to automatically identify students or learning aims that need to be included in the school census return. In this instance, you should speak to your supplier.</p>
	
	<h5 id="learning-aims-submitted-in-error">Learning aims submitted in error</h5>

	<h4 id="before-the-start-of-the-academic-year">Before the start of the academic year</h4>
	
	<p>Before recording details of learning aims for individual students, we recommend that schools produce a list of the qualifications that they will be providing.</p>
	
	<p>Each qualification in the school list should contain:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a qualification number</li>
	<li>a subject classification code</li>
	<li>a learning aim start date (students may have different start dates for the same learning aim)</li>
	<li>a learning aim planned end date (students may have different end dates for the same learning aim)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="at-the-start-of-the-academic-year">At the start of the academic year</h4>
	
	<p>At the beginning of the academic year, schools enter details for each learning aim undertaken by a student, using the school list. This includes courses starting in the current and those continuing from the previous academic year(s).</p>
	
	<p>For students undertaking a vocational study programme, schools should record the core learning aim (the principal or most important qualification). There is one core aim per student, per academic year. There is more information on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">core aim</a> on GOV.UK.</p>
	
	<h4 id="throughout-the-academic-year">Throughout the academic year</h4>
	
	<p>Throughout the academic year, schools may need to update the actual end date and status of the learning aim. When the learning aim status is continuing (the default value), the learning aim actual end date is left blank. When the student has completed, withdrawn or transferred from the learning aim, the learning aim actual end date reflects the date the status changed.</p>
	
	<h3 id="recording-planned-hours-used-for-funding">Recording planned hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The school that holds the pupil’s ‘main’ registration should collect and return the planned hours data.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>School A holds the main registration and has 120 planned hours, and school B (subsidiary registration) has 250 planned hours. In this instance, school A would make the return (370 planned hours), with school B making no return for this student.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h4 id="planned-learning-hours-used-for-funding">Planned learning hours [used for funding]</h4>
	
	<p>In this field, we need data on the total planned hours the student will spend on 16 to 19 funded qualifications for the current academic year. The value you record is the number of hours as planned at the start of the programme.</p>
	
	<p>If the number of planned hours changes later in the year, schools do not need to update the census.</p>
	
	<p>Detailed information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-planned-hours-in-study-programmes">recording planned hours</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>
	
	<h4 id="planned-employability-enrichment-and-pastoral-hours-used-for-funding">Planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours [used for funding]</h4>
	
	<p>In this field, we need data on the total planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours for the student for the current academic year. The value you record is the number of hours as planned at the start of the programme.</p>
	
	<p>If the number of planned hours changes later in the year, you do not need to update the census.</p>
	
	<h3 id="core-aim-used-for-funding">Core aim [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>In this field, we need the core aim within a vocational ESFA 16 to 19 funded study. If a pupil follows an academic programme, schools must not record a core aim.</p>
	
	<h4 id="post-16-students-who-are-in-full-time-employment-used-for-funding">Post-16 students who are in full-time employment [used for funding]</h4>
	
	<p>Post-16 pupils must be in full-time education/training unless they are in full-time employment (20 hours or more per week). This field indicates pupils who are in full-time employment and are eligible for part-time education/training.</p>
	
	<h3 id="gcse-maths-and-english-condition-of-funding-used-for-funding">GCSE maths and English condition of funding [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Students aged 16 to 18 and 19 to 25 with an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan who do not hold a GCSE grade ‘9’ to ‘4’, ‘A*’ to ‘C’ or equivalent, must study maths and / or English as part of their programme. Maths and English study is a <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-maths-and-english-condition-of-funding">condition of funding</a>. We will remove funding for students who do not meet the condition.</p>
	
	<p>We need 2 data items in the census to record when students meet the condition of funding:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>English / maths GCSE highest prior attainment – used to determine if a student needs to take an approved English or maths GCSE or stepping stone qualification</li>
	<li>English / maths GCSE funding exemption - used to determine if a student is exempt from the condition of funding or has an equivalent UK qualification</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>There are only 2 exemptions to the condition of funding:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the student’s learning difficulty prevents them studying a GCSE or stepping stone qualification that meets the condition of funding: code ‘L’</li>
	<li>the student’s overseas qualification is equivalent to GCSE ‘9’ to ‘4’, ‘A*’ to ‘C’ code ‘O’</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You should record students who hold an equivalent UK qualification using code ‘U’.</p>
	
	<h3 id="english-and-maths-gcse-prior-attainment-year-group-used-for-funding">English and maths GCSE prior attainment year group [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The census records whether a student has achieved English and / or maths GCSEs at grades ‘9’ to ‘4’, ‘A*’ to ‘C’ by the end of year 11. We use this to determine whether a student is eligible for block 2 disadvantage funding.</p>
	
	<p>More information on disadvantage block 2 funding is in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a>.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sub-contracting-partner-ukprn">Sub-contracting partner UKPRN</h3>
	
	<p>The sub-contracting partner UKPRN is recorded for all learning aims that are sub-contracted to a third-party organisation where the education provision will be paid for with ESFA 16 to 19 funding.</p>
	
	<p>A school that is part of a consortium is not considered to be sub-contracting with the other schools in the consortium.</p>
	
	<p>Schools must record the UK provider registration number (UKPRN) against the learning aim(s) that are sub-contracted to the partner organisation.</p>
	
	<h3 id="learning-aim-withdrawal-reason">Learning aim withdrawal reason</h3>
	
	<p>You should select the reason that most closely matches the reason for the student leaving the course. You can only select one reason.</p>
	
	<p>You do not need to include students withdrawing to take up apprenticeships, traineeships or supported internships.</p>
	
	<h3 id="traineeships-used-for-funding">Traineeships [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Traineeships are programmes that prepare young people for employment so that they are able to progress successfully to apprenticeships or other sustainable jobs. If a traineeship programme includes work experience that must be the core aim.</p>
	
	<p>The traineeship indicator is set against each of the pupil’s learning aims. The default is set to ‘false’ (or ‘0’), and any learning aim that is part of a traineeship programme is recorded as ‘true’ (or ‘1’).</p>
	
	<p>Where learning aims from a previous academic year contribute to a traineeship, you do not need to flag them retrospectively.</p>
	
	<h3 id="recording-a-levels">Recording A levels</h3>
	
	<p>You can choose between 3 approaches for recording A levels. As long as the planned hours accurately record the student’s planned activity, the funding will be correct.</p>
	
	<h4 id="a-student-studying-for-an-a-level-who-does-not-intend-to-sit-the-as-level">A student studying for an A level who does not intend to sit the AS level</h4>
	
	<p>You record the A level for the first year with a learning aim planned end date reflecting the planned 2-year course.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, for a student starting an A level in September 2018 the start date will be 2018-09-01 and the planned end date will be 2020-07-31.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h4 id="a-student-planning-to-take-the-as-level-as-well-as-for-the-a-level">A student planning to take the AS level as well as for the A level</h4>

	<p>Any claimant who is in receipt of free school meals on or after 31 March 2018 should continue to receive free school meals until the end of the universal credit roll out period, and then until their phase of education ends. This applies until summer 2023 even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	
	<p>It is not necessary for schools / local authorities to calculate a family‘s annual taxable income. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) perform this income calculation and this figure is used to determine free school meal entitlement.</p>

	<li>in the armed forces of another nation and stationed in England</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Reserve units are not classed as the regular armed forces and such pupils are not recorded as service children on the school census. However, where a reserve soldier is acting in a full-time capacity, this is classified as regular service.</p>
	
	<p>The service children indicator is only relevant to children whose parents are designated as <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-status-category-definitions">personal category 1 or 2</a>. All parents will be aware of their personal category.</p>
	
	<h3 id="funded-free-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding">Funded free entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours record, for eligible pupils aged two, three and four years, the total number of free entitlement to early education funded hours in education provision (following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school. This information is provided by all schools with relevant age children: with the exception of city technology colleges and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	
	<p>All children become eligible for free early education from the term following a child’s third birthday irrespective of background or family circumstances (the universal free entitlement). A specified subset of disadvantaged two year olds also become eligible from the term following a child’s second birthday. Local authorities will confirm which children meet the eligibility criteria should schools not know. Some three and four-year-olds are also eligible for up to an additional 15 hours per week – the extended free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>The table below shows the dates of birth and year groups of children for whom funded free entitlement hours are required. Where a child falls into the cohorts listed below but is not in receipt of any funding via the free entitlements, a value of zero is recorded for funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>Data collected via the spring census is used by the department to determine the early years block of the dedicated schools grant allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>Although not used centrally by the department for funding allocations, funded free entitlement hours from the autumn and summer census may be used locally by local authorities for funding early education.</p>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours contain only the hours the pupil is in education provision and following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage. Such education will follow the department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and excludes any hours where the pupils are not receiving education or any additional hours that are funded by other means (such as the parent).</p>
	
	<p>From the 2019 to 2020 financial year, all children will be capped at 15 hours for the universal entitlement as we set out in our government response to the early years national funding formula in December 2016. This is a change and will be reflected in local authority funding from 2019 to 2020.</p>

	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year in ‘reception’ and above are funded as full-time equivalent pupils via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant and therefore funded free entitlement hours are not relevant or required for those pupils, as they are not funded via the free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the funded free entitlement hours spent in education at each school. The main registration records funded hours in education at the main registration, with the subsidiary recording funded hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>It is important that the funded free entitlement hours recorded on the census accurately reflect the hours at the setting to two decimal places. It should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes. For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 20 minutes, this is recorded as 10.33 and so on</li>

	<h3 id="extended-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding">Extended entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Extended entitlement hours are collected for 3 and 4 year old children, with working parents, who are in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school.</p>
	
	<p>As with the universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours become available – where the parent has a valid 30-hour code - from the term following a child’s third birthday until they reach compulsory school age. Extended entitlement hours are available for pupils aged three and those pupils aged four who are in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ or ‘N2’ only.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who are in ‘reception’ (or above) are not eligible for extended entitlement hours, as they are in full-time education.</p>
	
	<p>As with universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours are recorded to two decimal places and it should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes.
	For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 40 minutes, this is recorded as 10.67 of extended entitlement hours per week (up to a maximum of 15 hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a child is in receipt of extended entitlement hours, the maximum funded free entitlement hours allowable is 15 hours. The extended entitlement hours field must not include any universal funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>The 30-hour code indicator is an 11-digit integer that is required for pupils who claim extended entitlement hours. As with the extended entitlement hours field, this applies to all 3 year olds and those pupils aged 4 in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only. The code confirms the eligibility of working parents to receive the 15 extended entitlement hours funding. This is particularly important as parents may split this entitlement between 2 providers.</p>
	
	<p>The code, once issued, remains fixed and refers to a single parent / child combination -where a parent has two children, each child will have their own code. However, when the school is presented with the code by the parent, the school must confirm the code’s validity with their local authority.</p>
	
	<p>Where a child transfers school, the local authority must be informed of the transfer.</p>
	
	<p>From September 2018, foster children are eligible for 30 hours free childcare in certain circumstances. Foster parents will not apply for the extended free entitlement through the Childcare Service due to the additional eligibility checking steps required. The 30-hour code indicator will be issued by the local authority to the foster parents. Providers will still check the code in the same way as for any other parent taking up 30 hours. It should be noted that although it will still be an 11-digit code, it will begin with a different number to HMRC issued codes. This is to allow local management of the reconfirmation process. Further information about 30 hours free childcare is available in the Department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and the Department’s early years entitlements operational guidance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="disability-access-fund-indicator-used-for-funding">Disability access fund indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The disability access fund (DAF) indicator records, for eligible pupils aged three and four, the receipt of DAF funding. Three and four-year-olds will be eligible for the DAF if they meet the following criteria:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the child is in receipt of child disability living allowance</li>
	<li>the child receives free early education (via the universal entitlement or extended childcare hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 as at the 31 August in reception and above, who are funded via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant, are not eligible for DAF funding. Further information on the DAF is available in the early years national funding formula (EYNFF) operational guidance.</p>

	<p>Hours at setting are collected for the same pupils and schools for whom funded free entitlement hours are collected. This data item records for pupils aged 2, 3 and 4 years old, the total number of hours they spent in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school irrespective of who funded the hours – it is the total of:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any hours funded under the free early education entitlements</li>
	<li>plus any hours funded under extended entitlement (for working parents)</li>
	<li>plus any additional hours of education funded from other sources such as parents</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This information will allow the department to monitor the hours attended at maintained settings on the same basis as private / voluntary / independent provision.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the actual hours attending each school. The main registration records the hours in education at the main registration. The subsidiary registration records the hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>Hours at setting records the hours in education to two decimal places (that is, where a pupil has 10 and a-half-hours, for example, this is recorded as 10.50, with 10 and three-quarter hours being 10.75).</p>
	
	<h3 id="unit-contact-time">Unit contact time</h3>
	
	<p>Unit contact time collects the number of contact hours the pupil spends with the PRU / AP in census week. This includes time at the PRU / AP and where pupils receive education through home visits (or in hospital) the time in contact with staff members of the PRU / AP.</p>
	
	<p>Where the PRU / AP has arranged for the pupil to receive their education via another establishment (for example an FE college or work-placement) then the time under supervision of this establishment is counted as contact time. The PRU / AP remains responsible for recording attendance at the other establishment.</p>
	
	<p>In some cases, pupils will remain in their registered school while being visited by PRU / AP staff (through an outreach programme). This is not included in the unit contact time.</p>
	
	<h3 id="early-years-pupil-premium-used-for-funding">Early years pupil premium [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The early years pupil premium (EYPP) is additional funding for early years settings to improve the education they provide for disadvantaged 3 and 4 year olds (all 3 and 4 year olds are entitled to up to 15 hours per week of government funded free entitlement early education for 38 weeks of the year).</p>
	
	<p>Provided that they are taking the universal 15 hours free entitlement and meet the eligibility criteria, children become eligible to receive early years pupil premium from the term following a child’s third birthday and retain this entitlement until they move into ‘reception’, when they become eligible to receive the ‘mainstream’ pupil premium.</p>
	
	<p>Only children in receipt of EYPP in census week should be recorded with early years pupil premium receipt equal to ‘true’.</p>
	
	<p>EYPP is paid by local authorities direct to settings. Its award is dependent on the application by parents of eligible children to their local authority, which will use the eligibility checking service to verify their application against benefits related data.</p>
	
	<p>Children are eligible to receive EYPP if they receive the universal 15 hours entitlement and either:</p>

	<p>This data, collected via the spring census, will be used by the department to determine the early years pupil premium allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>In the spring census, we need early years pupil premium data for:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>all 3 year olds - irrespective of school type and year group</li>
	<li>4 year olds at nursery schools (phase equals ‘NS’) – all year groups</li>
	<li>4 year olds at all schools other than nurseries (phase does not equal ‘NS’) – pupil national curriculum year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ onl

	<h3 id="learner-support-code-bursary-funding-for-16-to-19-year-olds-used-for-funding">Learner support code (bursary funding for 16 to 19 year olds) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The learner support code indicates the type of financial support awarded to pupils beyond compulsory school leaving age at any point in the academic year of the school census.</p>
	
	<p>There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursary fund support:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups (code ‘55’)</li>
	<li>discretionary bursaries which institutions award to meet individual needs, for example, help with the cost of transport, meals, books and equipment (code ‘56’)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The learner support code is collected for all pupils who have been awarded bursary funding in the current academic year. This may include pupils who have left the school since the start of the academic year. For dual registered pupils, the school holding the main registration for the pupil is responsible for awarding the bursary fund and return the required data.</p>
	
	<p>The 16 to 19 bursary fund is administered locally by providers and local authorities who receive their funding allocation directly from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). Whilst schools may be able to record in their systems other types of financial support awarded to these pupils, the school census only collects codes 55 and 56.</p>
	
	<p>During the academic year the circumstances of a student awarded the discretionary element may change and they could become part of a designated vulnerable group. In such circumstances the individual would also qualify for the award of the vulnerable payment (on a pro-rata basis for the academic year). For example, a student may be awarded the discretionary element in September 2018 and then the vulnerable group bursary in February 2019. In such a situation, code 56 would be returned in the spring school census and both code ‘56’ and code ‘55’ in the summer school census.</p>
	
	<p>Information about whether a student is actually in receipt of funding is not required for the school census. The purpose of the collection is to establish how many students been awarded bursary funding in the academic year.</p>
	
	<p>Each new academic year requires a new application for funding by students.</p>
	
	<h3 id="top-up-funding-indicator-used-for-funding">Top-up funding indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We are using the top-up funding indicator in the new high needs national funding formula that has been introduced to calculate high needs funding allocation from 2018 to 2019. In addition, we use this indicator for research purposes and to provide benchmarking information to local areas. As such, it is very important that all schools complete this correctly and follow the guidance provided.</p>
	
	<p>This is a true / false flag to indicate those pupils on roll for whom the school receives, on census day, top-up funding - either from a local authority or, in the case of a PRU / AP, a local authority or another school.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid outside a maintained school’s budget share or academy’s general annual grant and relates to a pupil or student identified as requiring additional support, which costs more than a specified threshold. In many cases, the period for which top-up funding is paid may not be defined but the top-up funding will - as with the SEN provision to which it relates - be subject to periodic review.</p>
	
	<p>Usually, but not always, the pupils for whom a primary or secondary mainstream school receives top-up funding are those with an education, health and care (EHC) plan. Sometimes local authorities may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - SEN support. Locally this top-up funding may be called by a different name: in cases of doubt, schools should check with their local authority to make sure that this is recorded correctly for each individual pupil.</p>
	
	<p>The specified cost threshold for additional SEN support varies according to the type of provision. For primary and secondary mainstream schools and academies, the threshold is £6,000 per pupil per annum in all cases.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid in respect of individual pupils whose additional support costs more than this, and is for the excess costs over the threshold. However, in the case of all special schools, special academies, special free schools, PRU / AP, the funding they receive is £10,000 per place, and the top-up funding will be for the costs incurred by the school in providing additional support in excess of this funding. Because the full cost of places in special schools, special academies and special free schools, PRU / AP usually exceeds £10,000, these types of schools will normally receive top-up funding for most, if not all, of the pupils in the school.</p>
	
	<h3 id="post-looked-after-arrangements-used-for-funding">Post looked after arrangements [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Post looked after arrangements collects information regarding children, who – on census day – have left local authority care in England and Wales through adoption, a special guardianship order, a residence order or a child arrangements order. Children who have left care under one of the measures listed above will be eligible for the post looked after element of the pupil premium.</p>
	
	<p>It is for those with parental responsibility (adoptive parents, special guardians and carers of former looked after children on residence / child arrangements orders) to decide if they wish to self-declare their children’s status to schools. Schools should ensure parents and carers are aware of this and that this information is collected to help ensure that the designated teacher for previously looked after children can support those children and the school can attract pupil premium funding to support this cohort. Parents are to provide supporting evidence, for example, a photocopy of the adoption order, and confirm that their child was previously in care in England or Wales.</p>
	
	<p>Parents may conceal sensitive information (for example the name of the birth parents) should they wish.</p>
	
	<p>Schools are reminded that this is particularly sensitive data and of the ongoing need for confidentiality. Schools should ensure that, as for other pupil level data items, they comply with their responsibilities with respect to GDPR when processing this data.</p>
	
	<p>Schools record the information using the following codeset. Only one of the values will apply to each pupil and a school’s MIS should provide a default value of N – not declared.</p>

	<p>You need to collect data items in this section for each census collection for any pupils registered on census day. We all require data for any pupils that are no longer registered but you are declaring in your return as excluded.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unique-pupil-number-upn-used-for-funding">Unique pupil number (UPN) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The UPN is a 13-character code that identifies each pupil in local-authority-maintained schools.</p>
	
	<p>You should not calculate it manually as the UPN would either be:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>generated by management information system (MIS)</li>
	<li>transferred to you from another school in a common transfer file (CTF)
	‘AnnnnnnnnnnnA’ is a temporary UPN that you should only use as an interim measure</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 id="pupils-former-upn">Pupil’s former UPN</h4>
	
	<p>If a pupil is adopted, they will get a new unique pupil number (UPN). You should not return their previous UPN in this field.</p>
	
	<p>If a (non-adopted) pupil has held another UPN whilst at your school (for example, the pupil had a temporary UPN when they first started, which has now been replaced by a permanent one), you should return the temporary UPN in this field.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unique-learner-number-uln-used-for-funding">Unique learner number (ULN) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>ULNs are assigned to pupils aged 14 or over in publicly funded education and training.</p>
	
	<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lrs-help-and-support">learning records service</a> (LRS) allocates this number.</p>

	
	<p>If you need to either get or verify a ULN or make minor updates to student data, you should send common transfer file from their management information systems to LRS using <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-to-school-guides-for-schools-and-local-authorities">School to School (S2S)</a>. You will get a CTF back via S2S with the requested ULNs.</p>
	
	<p>Schools should check with their software supplier if their management information system interacts directly with the LRS system via its application-programming interface (API).</p>
	
	<h2 id="pupil-status">Pupil status</h2>
	
	<p>We need pupil status data for all pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>You should add pupil date of entry, date of leaving and part-time indicator for any pupils who are no longer on roll, but are included in your attendance and exclusion data.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-enrolment-status-used-for-funding">Pupil enrolment status [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The pupil enrolment status - recorded within the schools management information system (MIS) using one of the registration codes. It is important that each pupil recorded within the school census be assigned a correct enrolment status. This ensures the pupil is correctly registered at a school in line with the pupil registration regulations.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils recorded as ‘guest’ should not be included in the census return.</p>
	
	<p>The MIS will automatically default the value of this field to ‘C’ - current (single registration at this school).</p>
	
	<h4 id="managed--negotiated-transfers">Managed / negotiated transfers</h4>
	
	<p>A pupil may transfer to another school on a trial basis. In such cases, the original school maintains the pupil’s registration. Where the receiving school decides to accept the pupil on a permanent basis, the registration transfers at that time.</p>
	
	<p>During the trial period, there is no method of recording this situation in the receiving school. As data collected during the census is used for future funding purposes, the inability to credit the receiving school is perceived as a disincentive to accept the pupil, often to the pupil’s detriment. The financial arrangements between the schools are a matter for their mutual agreement, but it is important to be able to identify pupils in this situation.</p>
	
	<p>It is recommended that for the duration of any trial period:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the original school maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘M’ (current main - dual registration)</li>
	<li>the receiving school maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘S’ (current subsidiary - dual registration)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="consortia-schools">Consortia schools</h4>
	
	<p>Schools often provide courses of study in collaboration with other schools (or other educational establishments) and these may be formal or informal arrangements. A pupil registered in one school may have part of their academic tuition in the premises of another school.</p>
	
	<p>In such circumstances, it is important that the pupil be correctly assigned to the school that holds the pupil’s registration. The financial arrangements between the schools are a matter for their mutual agreement but it is important to be able to identify pupils in this situation.</p>
	
	<p>It is recommended that for a pupil who is receiving tuition at a school other than the registration school:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the registration school maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘C’ (current - single registration at this school)</li>
	<li>the providing school maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘G’ (guest - pupil not registered at this school but attending some lessons or sessions)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="post-16-and-diploma-pupils">Post 16 and diploma pupils</h4>
	
	<p>The guidance provided above for consortia schools will be the same for post-16 pupils and pupils who are attending tuition in the premises of another school as part of diploma arrangements.</p>
	
	<h4 id="traveller-pupils">Traveller pupils</h4>
	
	<p>A traveller pupil may attend another school during periods when his / her parent(s) is /are travelling in the course of trade or business. To help ensure continuity of education for traveller children, it is expected that the child should attend school elsewhere when their family is travelling and be dual registered at that school and the school which the pupil would normally attend when not travelling.</p>
	
	<p>It is recommended that for the duration of this period:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the ordinary school of attendance maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘M’ (current main - dual registration)</li>
	<li>the receiving school maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘S’ (current subsidiary - dual registration)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>However, as outlined in the pupil registration regulations, if the child does not return to the ordinary school of attendance within 18 months, after checking with the children missing education officer, the pupil should be removed from the school roll.</p>
	
	<h4 id="family-units">Family units</h4>
	
	<p>In many areas, early education is being provided in establishments that also provide wider childcare and / or family support services. Often, the establishment wishes to maintain a single management information system for all the children it serves and, equally often, it is the school management information system that is used for this purpose.</p>
	
	<p>When submitting information for census purposes, it is important to distinguish between those children who are receiving early education and those who are receiving other services. It is recommended that:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>for children receiving early education, the school / establishment maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘C’ (current - single registration at this school)</li>
	<li>for children receiving childcare provision but not early education the school / establishment, if it wishes to do so, maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘G’ (guest - pupil not registered at this school but attending some lessons or sessions)</li>
	<li>for children receiving both early education and childcare provision, the school /establishment records the pupil as part-time and maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘C’ (current - single registration at this school)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="specialised-units">Specialised units</h4>
	
	<p>In some local authority areas, units have been established to deliver specialised education services for pupils from schools in an extended area, not just the school in which the unit is located.</p>
	
	<p>These units often provide support for pupils with special educational needs requirements, commonly with those children who have visual or hearing impairments or have speech and language difficulties. It is recommended that, for a pupil who is receiving tuition in a specialised unit at a school other than the registration school:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the registration school maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘C’ (current - single registration at this school)</li>
	<li>the providing school, if it wishes to do so, maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘G’ (guest - pupil not registered at this school but attending some lessons or sessions)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5 id="inclusion-classes">Inclusion classes</h5>
	
	<p>To foster the inclusion agenda for pupils with special educational needs, ‘inclusion classes’ have been established whereby pupils who are registered at a special school are taught in classes located in a mainstream school’s premises. Tuition is provided, either wholly or partly, by teachers from the special school.</p>
	
	<p>These classes are, effectively, satellite classes of the special school and should not be treated as classes of the mainstream school. It is recommended that for a pupil who is attending an inclusion class:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the special school maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘C’ (current - single registration at this school)</li>
	<li>the mainstream school, if it wishes to do so, maintains the pupil’s record with an enrolment status of ‘G’ (guest - pupil not registered at this school but attending some lessons or sessions)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5 id="external-candidates">External candidates</h5>
	
	<p>Occasionally, adults are registered at a school in order for them to enter an examination and, perhaps, receive some level of tuition towards this aim. In such cases it is recommended that the providing school, if it wishes to do so, maintains the adult’s record with an enrolment status of ‘G’ (guest - pupil not registered at this school but attending some lessons or sessions).</p>
	
	<h5 id="purchased-tuition">Purchased tuition</h5>
	
	<p>In some schools externally provided tuition may be purchased at another establishment for a registered pupil.</p>
	
	<p>Where the provider establishment is a maintained school then the situation should be treated as for consortia schools above.</p>
	
	<p>Where the provider is a commercial organisation - or an organisation outside the maintained school sector - then the pupil should be recorded with an enrolment status of ‘C’ (current – single registration at this school).</p>
	
	<h5 id="school-supervised-off-site-education">School-supervised off-site education</h5>
	
	<p>Some schools have registered pupils who receive all or part of their education off-site, under the supervision of the school. Such pupils can only be recorded as receiving offsite educational activity if the activity meets the requirements set out in the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006.</p>
	
	<p>The activity must be of an educational nature approved by the school and supervised by someone authorised by the school.</p>
	
	<p>The activity must take place during the session for which code ‘B’ (attending off-site educational activity) is recorded in the attendance register. In such cases, the pupil should be recorded with an enrolment status of ‘C’ (current - single registration at this school).</p>
	
	<h4 id="dually-registered-pupils---hospital-special-schools">Dually registered pupils - hospital special schools</h4>
	
	<p>Pupils attending a hospital special school are recorded on the register where they are in education. They are not recorded where they attend the establishment for:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>hospital check ups</li>
	<li>day surgery</li>
	<li>any other form of medical appointment</li>
	<li>an operation</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a pupil receives education from the hospital special school and also attends a mainstream school, the pupil is recorded as dually registered. The school of ‘ordinary attendance’ is recorded as the ‘main’ registration. In the majority of cases, this will be the mainstream school, and the hospital special school records the pupil with a subsidiary registration. Where a pupil receives education from the hospital special school during their stay in hospital, they are recorded as a ‘guest’ registration.</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is originally solely registered at the hospital special school and also attends a mainstream school as part of a reintegration programme, the pupil is dually registered with the hospital special school holding the ‘main registration’.</p>
	
	<h5 id="overseas--exchange-pupils">Overseas / exchange pupils</h5>
	
	<p>Pre-16 overseas or exchange pupils on the school register on census day recorded with an enrolment status of ‘G’ (guest - pupil not registered at this school but attending some lessons or sessions) are not included on the school census returns.</p>
	
	<p>For post-16 overseas or exchange pupils, some students, who are not citizens of the UK or citizens of a European Economic Area (EEA) country, may be eligible to receive public funding. The funding regulations provide full rules that determine which overseas students can be funded.</p>
	
	<p>With respect to exchange students: the school must be able to evidence that a pupil who would otherwise have attended the school has ‘moved in exchange’ to balance the non-British student attending the school on exchange. If there is a genuine exchange in place, the school can receive funding for the exchange student – with the exception of students with tier 4 visas.</p>
	
	<p>As with pre-16 pupils, post-16 overseas or exchange pupils on the school register on census day are recorded with an enrolment status of ‘G’ (guest - pupil not registered at this school but attending some lessons or sessions) and not included on the school census returns.</p>
	
	<h3 id="class-type">Class type</h3>
	
	<p>Denotes a class as a designated nursery class. A nursery class is one designated by the local authority - any class not designated by the local authority is counted as an “other” (code ‘O’) class even if it contains nursery-age pupils.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-date-of-entry-used-for-funding">Pupil date of entry [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-part-time-indicator-used-for-funding">Pupil part-time indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This indicates whether a pupil is part-time in education (attends fewer than 10 sessions per week). It does not indicate that a pupil is part-time at one or more establishments.</p>
	
	<p>A pupil attending 3 full days in one school and 2 full days in another school is not classified by either school as part-time. The MIS will automatically default the value of this field to ‘false’ (not part-time) as the majority of pupils will not be part-time.</p>
	
	<p>For children in receipt of funded early education, a child should only be recorded as full-time where they attend education for 10 sessions per week irrespective of the number of funded and / or extended childcare hours.</p>
	
	<p>In certain circumstances some pupils of compulsory school-age will be placed on a part-time timetable in order to meet their individual needs, for example when a medical condition prevents them from attending full-time, as part of a re-integration package.</p>
	
	<p>The part-time timetable should not be treated as a long-term solution. Any pastoral support programme or other agreement must have a time limit by which point the pupil is expected to attend full-time and be agreed with the pupil’s parents / carers.</p>
	
	<p>Compulsory school-age pupils on a part-time timetable are not present at school for part of the week or day. They do not attend approved educational activity and are absent from school. In agreeing to the part-time timetable, the school has agreed to the absence and to record it as an authorised absence. This ensures the school has a record of the amount of education a pupil has missed and helps it to identify pupils that may need additional support. Schools cannot record the pupil as ‘not required to attend’ or that the school was closed to the pupil in question, as this would contravene the regulations.</p>
	
	<p>Compulsory school-age pupils on a part-time timetable are recorded as fulltime with the appropriate absence code used for the sessions they do not attend.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-boarder-indicator-used-for-funding">Pupil boarder indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Indicates whether a pupil is a boarder. The MIS automatically defaults the value of this field to ‘N’ - not a boarder.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupils-actual-national-curriculum-year-group-used-for-funding">Pupil’s actual national curriculum year group [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The year group in which the pupil is taught for the majority of their time, irrespective of their chronological age.</p>
	
	<p>Children turning 2 years old fall into the ‘E2’ year group. If they are recorded on the school’s admission register, you need to include them in your census return.</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect any younger children who fall into the ‘E1’ year group to be in receipt of education and should not be on the school’s admissions register. If you need to record children in ‘E1’ within your MIS, you should record with an enrolment status of ‘guest’ and not include them in your census.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupils-actual-national-curriculum-year-on-leaving">Pupil’s actual national curriculum year on leaving</h3>
	
	<p>The year group in which the pupil was taught for the majority of their time, irrespective of their chronological age, at the date they left the school.</p>
	
	<p>This data is only required from secondary schools with sixth form pupils who left the school prior to the autumn census day and they are submitting post-16 learning aims information about.</p>
	
	<h2 id="special-educational-needs-sen">Special educational needs (SEN)</h2>

	<h3 id="pupil-sen-type-ranking">Pupil SEN type ranking</h3>
	
	<p>This indicates the ranking of a pupil’s special educational need, as recorded in pupil SEN type. The most significant, or primary need, is ranked as ‘1’ with any secondary need ranked ‘2’. Only 2 rankings are collected in the school census, if there is more than one SEN type reported they cannot both have a ranking of ‘1’.</p>

	<p>This field records the nature (type) of a pupil’s special educational need. We collect this data in the spring census for all pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>Schools need to add a type of need for all pupils they are identifying as having special educational needs in the return.</p>
	
	<p>You should only use the NSA code (‘NSA’) where a pupil is placed on SEN support (code ‘K’), but the school is still assessing what the primary need is.</p>
	
	<h3 id="member-of-sen-unit-used-for-funding">Member of SEN unit [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This field identifies pupils with SEN who are members of an SEN unit. SEN units are special provisions within a mainstream school where the pupils with SEN are taught mainly within separate classes.</p>
	
	<p>Units:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>are designated by the local authority specifically for making SEN provision, and sometimes accommodate pupils registered at other schools on a part-time basis</li>
	<li>receive funding of £6,000 or £10,000 per place, and usually top-up funding for the excess costs of additional support required by individual pupils</li>
	<li>cater for a specific type or types of SEN (for example autistic spectrum disorders)</li>
	<li>are usually for pupils with an education, health and care (EHC) plan (but may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - SEN support)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Schools and academies should only use this indicator where the SEN unit has been formally recognised as such by the local authority where the school is located.</p>
	
	<h3 id="member-of-resourced-provision-indicator-used-for-funding">Member of resourced provision indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This field identifies pupils who receive support for their type of SEN from a specialist-resourced provision.</p>
	
	<p>Resourced provisions are places that are reserved at a mainstream school for pupils with a specific type of SEN, taught mainly within mainstream classes, but requiring a base and some specialist facilities around the school.</p>
	
	<p>Resourced provisions:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>are designated by the local authority specifically for making this kind of SEN provision</li>
	<li>receive funding of £6,000 or £10,000 per place, and usually top-up funding for the excess costs of additional support required by individual pupils</li>
	<li>cater for a specific area or areas of SEN (for example specific learning difficulties)</li>
	<li>are usually for pupils with an education, health and care (EHC) plan - but could include pupils with code ‘K’ (SEN support)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Schools and academies should only use this indicator where the resourced provision has been formally recognised as such by the local authority where the school is located.</p>
	
	<h2 id="survey-reference-dates">Survey reference dates</h2>
	
	<p>Your management information system (MIS) generates the survey reference dates (in the format yyyy-mm-dd).</p>
	
	<p>Your MIS should have a facility to edit this in unusual circumstances.</p>
