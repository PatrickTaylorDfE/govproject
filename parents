<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you’ve applied to a school and it does not offer your child a place, you can appeal the decision.</p>

<p>There are things you need to consider before you make a school admission appeal. Should you wish to make an appeal, you will have to set this out in writing and attend an appeal hearing.</p>

<h2 id="your-right-of-appeal">Your right of appeal</h2>

<p>You have the right to appeal a decision to refuse your child a place at a school.</p>

<p>You can only appeal once for a place in a school in the same academic year.</p>

<p>An exception to this is where there’s a significant change in your circumstances and the admission authority accepts a second application from you, but again decides not to offer your child a place. In which case, you can appeal this decision again.</p>

<p>If your child has an Education Health &amp; Care Plan (EHC Plan) that names a specific school they must admit your child.</p>

<p>If the school named in the EHC refuses to admit your child, speak to your local authority. They can ask the Secretary of State for Education to determine whether the admission authority is failing to carry out its statutory duties. They can use their powers under the Education Act 1996 to direct the school to admit your child.</p>

<p>If you’re unhappy with the school named in the EHC plan, you may appeal to the <a href="www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-special-educational-needs-and-disability">First-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs &amp; Disability)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-consider-before-you-appeal">Things to consider before you appeal</h3>

<p>Before you make an appeal, it will help you to understand how the school allocated their places, so you can understand why your child did not get a place.</p>

<p>An appeal can prolong the process of securing a school place for your child, so it is important to be realistic about your reasons for appealing and the chances of being successful.</p>

<p>This is particularly the case if you’re appealing a decision to refuse admission to an infant class, such as a reception class, where the law prevents a school from admitting more than 30 pupils, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="how-schools-allocate-places">How schools allocate places</h2>

<p>Admission arrangements for individual schools are set and applied locally. It’s the role of the school’s admission authority to decide what admissions criteria to set, as long as they comply with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">School Admissions Code</a>.</p>

<p>The admission authority for a community or voluntary controlled school is the local authority. For a foundation or voluntary aided school, it’s the school’s governing body and for academies and free schools, it’s the academy trust.</p>

<p>When there are more applicants than places, the admission authority uses their admissions criteria to allocate places. The admission criteria sets out the order of priorities they will use to allocate places.</p>

<p>The admission authority must allocate places at the school in accordance with these criteria. They can usually be found on schools’ or local authorities’ websites.</p>

<h3 id="reasons-for-refusing-admission">Reasons for refusing admission</h3>

<p>The appeals process can be a burdensome process for schools, so admission authorities do not take lightly the decision to refuse a child a school place.</p>

<p>The reason why they refused your child a place will be in your admissions decision letter. If this is missing or it’s not clear, you can contact the admission authority for more information. Their contact details should be on the letter.</p>

<p>In most cases, your child will not have been offered a place because there were other children that more closely met the school’s admissions criteria.</p>

<p>If you made an application outside the normal points of entry, typically at reception and year 7, it is likely that the school was not able to offer your child a place because the year group you applied for is full.</p>

<p>Admission authorities are also able to refuse in-year applications on the basis that a child has challenging behaviour, which the school is unable to accommodate. In this case, the admission authority will refer the child to the local authority, who will find a more suitable school place through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fair-access-protocols-in-school-admissions">Fair Access Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>The decision letter from the admission authority, informing you that they have refused your child a place at the school, will explain how you can appeal this decision.</p>

<p>You will need to submit your appeal in writing, setting out why the admission authority should have offered your child a place. You will usually appeal to the admission authority of the school, who should allow you at least 20 school days to prepare and submit your written appeal.</p>

<p>If you cannot send all the information and supporting evidence you want to at the time you lodge your appeal, it is important you send it before the deadline given by the admission authority.</p>

<p>This is because the clerk needs to send it to the panel and admission authority for them to consider before the hearing. If you submit anything after the deadline, the panel may not have time to consider it or it may delay your hearing.</p>

<p>Once you have lodged an appeal, the panel clerk will let you know the time, date and location of your appeal hearing. They will give you at least 10 school days’ notice, unless you have let them know you do not need this much notice.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-at-an-appeal-hearing">What happens at an appeal hearing?</h3>

<p>It’s important you understand what will happen at the hearing, so that you can be prepared. The clerk, responsible for all the administrative arrangements for the appeal, will explain everything that will happen on the day of and after your hearing. They will also be available to provide independent advice on the appeals process and any queries you may have.</p>

<p>You’ll need to explain the reasons for your appeal to the panel at the hearing. There are usually 3 people on the panel. If you wish, you can take a friend or a family member with you for support at the hearing. If you require it, you can also request to have an interpreter present.</p>

<p>A representative for the admission authority, usually referred to as the presenting officer, will also be there to present the school’s case to the panel. There can be more than 1 representative present.</p>

<p>The panel will then make the decision to either uphold or dismiss your appeal.</p>

<h2 id="standard-appeal-hearings">Standard appeal hearings</h2>

<h3 id="stage-1--the-schools-case-for-refusing-admission">Stage 1 – The school’s case for refusing admission</h3>

<p>The school’s presenting officer will explain why the school cannot admit any more children. This will be your opportunity to ask questions and challenge the presenting officer about why the school cannot admit more children.</p>

<p>If there are multiple appeals for places at the same school, for the same year group, then the school will usually present their case with all the parents together.</p>

<p>Once the presenting officer has presented the school’s case, all the appellants, and the presenting officer, will leave the room so that the panel can make a decision on whether to uphold your appeal at this stage or proceed to Stage 2.</p>

<p>The panel will uphold your appeal if it finds that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the school’s admission arrangements were unlawful and/or were not applied properly in your child’s case and that your child would have been offered a place if they were lawful/correctly applied</li>
  <li>admitting another child at the school would not negatively affect the delivery of education or the education of the other children already admitted at the school</li>
</ul>

<p>If the panel does not uphold your appeal, it will proceed to Stage 2.</p>

<h3 id="stage-2--parents-case-for-appeal">Stage 2 – Parents’ case for appeal</h3>

<p>If the appeal proceeds to Stage 2 this is when you’ll present your case to the panel. You’ll do this individually, and only present your case to the panel and the presenting officer. You’ll need to explain why you believe the school should admit your child. The panel and the presenting officer may ask you questions about your case.</p>

<p>This stage usually lasts around 20 to 60 minutes, but you can request more time if you need it. The panel may not be able to consider any new information or evidence you present, if you’ve not already submitted it in writing.</p>

<p>If there are a significant number of appeals, you might not present on the same day as the school’s presenting officer. The clerk will notify you of the exact timings of your appeal.</p>

<p>After you’ve presented your case, you and the presenting officer will leave the room. The panel will discuss the case and make a decision to either uphold or dismiss your appeal. They will balance your case for wanting your child to attend the school, against the school’s arguments for not being able to admit another child. The panel will uphold your appeal if it finds that your case outweighs the case put forward by the school.</p>

<h3 id="your-case-for-appeal">Your case for appeal</h3>

<p>It’s important that you clearly set out the reasons why your child should have a place at the school in both your written appeal and the case that you present at the hearing.</p>

<p>You can make an appeal because you want your child to attend a particular school, over any other, but the stronger your reasons, the more likely it is that the panel will uphold your appeal.</p>

<p>For example, wanting your child to go to particular school because it’s the best in the area is not likely to convince the panel that your child should get a place at the school over another child.</p>

<p>You should focus on what the school can offer that meets any particular needs of your child, including what the school can offer that others cannot.</p>

<p>Other grounds for appeal might be that you believe that the admission authority did not apply their admission arrangements properly and if they had applied them properly, then they would have offered your child a place at the school.</p>

<h2 id="appeals-for-grammar-schools">Appeals for grammar schools</h2>

<p>If your child passed the entrance exam, but was not offered a place because there were other children that more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the appeals process is the same, as all other school admission appeals.</p>

<p>If your child did not pass the entrance exam, then the panel will consider your appeal differently. The panel will only uphold the appeal if it’s satisfied that your child meets the required academic standards and is suitable for a grammar school education.</p>

<p>To support your appeal you could include school reports and references from your child’s current school that show your child meets the required standards.</p>

<p>The panel may also consider any special circumstances that may have prevented your child from performing well on the exam for example because they were ill. The panel will decide if these factors would have affected the outcome of the test.</p>

<p>Some admission authorities will carry out a local review to consider whether a child who has failed the entrance exam is of grammar school ability, before they make a decision not to offer the child a place. If they do this, then the appeal panel will only consider whether the admission authority carried out the review in a fair, consistent and objective way. It will not carry out the review process again.</p>

<h2 id="appeals-for-boarding-schools">Appeals for boarding schools</h2>

<p>If the boarding school did not offer your child a place, because there were other children that more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the appeals process is the same as all other school admission appeals.</p>

<p>If your child has been refused admission because the admission authority decided they were ‘unsuitable to board’, the panel will consider whether this decision was reasonable in the light of the available information.</p>

<p>They will not carry out their own assessment of whether your child is suitable to board.</p>

<h2 id="appeals-for-school-sixth-forms">Appeals for school sixth forms</h2>

<p>If the school sixth form did not offer your child a place, both you and your child have the right to appeal. If they did not offer your child a place, because there were others that more closely met their admissions criteria, then the appeals process is the same as all other school admission appeals.</p>

<p>If your child did not meet the specified entry requirements (for example 5 GCSEs grade 4 or above), the panel will only uphold the appeal if it considers that the admission authority’s decision was unreasonable in light of the information provided.</p>

<p>For example, if there are specific reasons or special circumstances that meant your child was not able to get the required GCSEs at the relevant grades.</p>

<h2 id="infant-class-size-appeals">Infant class size appeals</h2>

<p>The law limits the size of an infant class (reception year and years 1 and 2) to a maximum of 30 pupils per teacher. If the school refuses your child a place because admitting them would breach this limit, then your appeal will be an infant class size appeal. This is different from all other school admission appeals.</p>

<p>In an infant class size appeal, a panel will only uphold the appeal where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it finds that the admission of an additional child would not breach the infant class size limit</li>
  <li>if it finds that the school’s admission arrangements were unlawful, or had not been properly applied, and the child would have been offered a place at the school if the arrangements were lawful or had been properly applied</li>
  <li>it decides that the decision to refuse admission was not one, which a reasonable admission authority would have made in the circumstances of the case</li>
</ul>

<p>To find a decision to be unreasonable, the panel would need to be satisfied that the decision to refuse admission was ‘perverse in the light of the admission arrangements’ meaning that it was so irrational that no other reasonable admission authority would have come to the same decision.</p>

<p>A decision that makes it impossible for you to transport all your children to school on time is unlikely to be perverse. However, a decision to refuse a place to a child, whose family had to relocate under a witness protection scheme, might be.</p>

<p>The threshold for finding that an admission authority’s decision to refuse admission was unreasonable is high.</p>

<p>As such, it’s unlikely that a panel would uphold the appeal on that basis. It’s important that parents recognise this before investing what can be a significant amount of time and effort, in an infant class size appeal.</p>

<p>Before you make your decision to appeal, you should think carefully about your reasons for appeal and be realistic about the likely outcome.</p>

<h2 id="after-the-appeal-hearing">After the appeal hearing</h2>

<p>The clerk will normally write to you within 5 school days to notify you of the panel’s decision. If the panel is hearing a large number of appeals, this may delay the notification letter. The clerk should inform you if that is the case.</p>

<p>The decision of the appeal panel is binding and only the courts, by way of a judicial review, can overturn a decision.</p>

<p>If the panel uphold your appeal, the admission authority must admit your child.</p>

<p>If the panel do not uphold your appeal, you still have a number of options you may wish to consider.</p>

<h3 id="waiting-lists">Waiting lists</h3>

<p>Admission authorities must operate a waiting list for at least the first term of each school year of admission. If the panel do not uphold your appeal, you may wish to put your child’s name on the school’s waiting list.</p>

<p>School places may become available, as not all children offered a place take them. If places become available, the admission authority will allocate the places in accordance with the school’s published admissions criteria.</p>

<h3 id="seeking-an-alternative-school-place">Seeking an alternative school place</h3>

<p>It’s your responsibility to secure a suitable education for your child. If your child is without a school place, contact the local authority who will be able to advise you of other available places in the area.</p>

<h3 id="complaints-about-appeals">Complaints about appeals</h3>

<p>If the panel did not uphold your appeal and you think that the admission authority or the appeal panel has acted incorrectly, you may make a complaint of maladministration.</p>

<p>Any complaint must relate to issues such as failure to follow correct procedure or failure to act independently or fairly. You cannot complain simply because you do not agree with the panel’s decision.</p>

<p>For complaints against the appeal panel for a school maintained by your local authority, you should complain to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.lgo.org.uk">Local Government Ombudsman</a>.</p>

<p>For complaints against the appeal panel for an academy, you should complain to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions/appealing-a-schools-decision">Education Skills and Funding Agency</a>.</p>

In which case, you can appeal this decision again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child has an Education Health \u0026amp; Care Plan (EHC Plan) that names a specific school they must admit your child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the school named in the EHC refuses to admit your child, speak to your local authority. They can ask the Secretary of State for Education to determine whether the admission authority is failing to carry out its statutory duties. They can use their powers under the Education Act 1996 to direct the school to admit your child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re unhappy with the school named in the EHC plan, you may appeal to the \u003ca href=\"www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-special-educational-needs-and-disability\"\u003eFirst-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs \u0026amp; Disability)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"things-to-consider-before-you-appeal\"\u003eThings to consider before you appeal\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you make an appeal, it will help you to understand how the school allocated their places, so you can understand why your child did not get a place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn appeal can prolong the process of securing a school place for your child, so it is important to be realistic about your reasons for appealing and the chances of being successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is particularly the case if you’re appealing a decision to refuse admission to an infant class, such as a reception class, where the law prevents a school from admitting more than 30 pupils, other than in exceptional circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-schools-allocate-places\"\u003eHow schools allocate places\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdmission arrangements for individual schools are set and applied locally. It’s the role of the school’s admission authority to decide what admissions criteria to set, as long as they comply with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2\"\u003eSchool Admissions Code\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe admission authority for a community or voluntary controlled school is the local authority. For a foundation or voluntary aided school, it’s the school’s governing body and for academies and free schools, it’s the academy trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen there are more applicants than places, the admission authority uses their admissions criteria to allocate places. The admission criteria sets out the order of priorities they will use to allocate places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe admission authority must allocate places at the school in accordance with these criteria. They can usually be found on schools’ or local authorities’ websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"reasons-for-refusing-admission\"\u003eReasons for refusing admission\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe appeals process can be a burdensome process for schools, so admission authorities do not take lightly the decision to refuse a child a school place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason why they refused your child a place will be in your admissions decision letter. If this is missing or it’s not clear, you can contact the admission authority for more information. Their contact details should be on the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn most cases, your child will not have been offered a place because there were other children that more closely met the school’s admissions criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you made an application outside the normal points of entry, typically at reception and year 7, it is likely that the school was not able to offer your child a place because the year group you applied for is full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdmission authorities are also able to refuse in-year applications on the basis that a child has challenging behaviour, which the school is unable to accommodate. In this case, the admission authority will refer the child to the local authority, who will find a more suitable school place through the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fair-access-protocols-in-school-admissions\"\u003eFair Access Protocol\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-appeals-process\"\u003eThe appeals process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision letter from the admission authority, informing you that they have refused your child a place at the school, will explain how you can appeal this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will need to submit your appeal in writing, setting out why the admission authority should have offered your child a place. You will usually appeal to the admission authority of the school, who should allow you at least 20 school days to prepare and submit your written appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you cannot send all the information and supporting evidence you want to at the time you lodge your appeal, it is important you send it before the deadline given by the admission authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is because the clerk needs to send it to the panel and admission authority for them to consider before the hearing. If you submit anything after the deadline, the panel may not have time to consider it or it may delay your hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have lodged an appeal, the panel clerk will let you know the time, date and location of your appeal hearing. They will give you at least 10 school days’ notice, unless you have let them know you do not need this much notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-happens-at-an-appeal-hearing\"\u003eWhat happens at an appeal hearing?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important you understand what will happen at the hearing, so that you can be prepared. The clerk, responsible for all the administrative arrangements for the appeal, will explain everything that will happen on the day of and after your hearing. They will also be available to provide independent advice on the appeals process and any queries you may have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll need to explain the reasons for your appeal to the panel at the hearing. There are usually 3 people on the panel. If you wish, you can take a friend or a family member with you for support at the hearing. If you require it, you can also request to have an interpreter present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA representative for the admission authority, usually referred to as the presenting officer, will also be there to present the school’s case to the panel. There can be more than 1 representative present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe panel will then make the decision to either uphold or dismiss your appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"standard-appeal-hearings\"\u003eStandard appeal hearings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"stage-1--the-schools-case-for-refusing-admission\"\u003eStage 1 – The school’s case for refusing admission\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe school’s presenting officer will explain why the school cannot admit any more children. This will be your opportunity to ask questions and challenge the presenting officer about why the school cannot admit more children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there are multiple appeals for places at the same school, for the same year group, then the school will usually present their case with all the parents together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the presenting officer has presented the school’s case, all the appellants, and the presenting officer, will leave the room so that the panel can make a decision on whether to uphold your appeal at this stage or proceed to Stage 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe panel will uphold your appeal if it finds that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003ethe school’s admission arrangements were unlawful and/or were not applied properly in your child’s case and that your child would have been offered a place if they were lawful/correctly applied\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eadmitting another child at the school would not negatively affect the delivery of education or the education of the other children already admitted at the school\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the panel does not uphold your appeal, it will proceed to Stage 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"stage-2--parents-case-for-appeal\"\u003eStage 2 – Parents’ case for appeal\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the appeal proceeds to Stage 2 is when you’ll present your case to the panel. You’ll do this individually, and only present your case to the panel and the presenting officer. You’ll need to explain why you believe the school should admit your child. The panel and the presenting officer may ask you questions about your case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis stage usually lasts around 20 to 60 minutes, but you can request more time if you need it. The panel may not be able to consider any new information or evidence you present, if you’ve not already submitted it in writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there are a significant number of appeals, you might not present on the same day as the school’s presenting officer. The clerk will notify you of the exact timings of your appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you’ve presented your case, you and the presenting officer will leave the room. The panel will discuss the case and make a decision to either uphold or dismiss your appeal. They will balance your case for wanting your child to attend the school, against the school’s arguments for not being able to admit another child. The panel will uphold your appeal if it finds that your case outweighs the case put forward by the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"your-case-for-appeal\"\u003eYour case for appeal\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s important that you clearly set out the reasons why your child should have a place at the school in both your written appeal and the case that you present at the hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can make an appeal because you want your child to attend a particular school, over any other, but the stronger your reasons, the more likely it is that the panel will uphold your appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, wanting your child to go to particular school because it’s the best in the area is not likely to convince the panel that your child should get a place at the school over another child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou should focus on what the school can offer that meets any particular needs of your child, including what the school can offer that others cannot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther grounds for appeal might be that you believe that the admission authority did not apply their admission arrangements properly and if they had applied them properly, then they would have offered your child a place at the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"appeals-for-grammar-schools\"\u003eAppeals for grammar schools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child passed the entrance exam, but was not offered a place because there were other children that more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the appeals process is the same, as all other school admission appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child did not pass the entrance exam, then the panel will consider your appeal differently. The panel will only uphold the appeal if it’s satisfied that your child meets the required academic standards and is suitable for a grammar school education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo support your appeal you could include school reports and references from your child’s current school that show your child meets the required standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe panel may also consider any special circumstances that may have prevented your child from performing well on the exam for example because they were ill. The panel will decide if these factors would have affected the outcome of the test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome admission authorities will carry out a local review to consider whether a child who has failed the entrance exam is of grammar school ability, before they make a decision not to offer the child a place. If they do this, then the appeal panel will only consider whether the admission authority carried out the review in a fair, consistent and objective way. It will not carry out the review process again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"appeals-for-boarding-schools\"\u003eAppeals for boarding schools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the boarding school did not offer your child a place, because there were other children that more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the appeals process is the same as all other school admission appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child has been refused admission because the admission authority decided they were ‘unsuitable to board’, the panel will consider whether this decision was reasonable in the light of the available information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey will not carry out their own assessment of whether your child is suitable to board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"appeals-for-school-sixth-forms\"\u003eAppeals for school sixth forms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the school sixth form did not offer your child a place, both you and your child have the right to appeal. If they did not offer your child a place, because there were others that more closely met their admissions criteria, then the appeals process is the same as all other school admission appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child did not meet the specified entry requirements (for example 5 GCSEs grade 4 or above), the panel will only uphold the appeal if it considers that the admission authority’s decision was unreasonable in light of the information provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, if there are specific reasons or special circumstances that meant your child was not able to get the required GCSEs at the relevant grades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"infant-class-size-appeals\"\u003eInfant class size appeals\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe law limits the size of an infant class (reception year and years 1 and 2) to a maximum of 30 pupils per teacher. If the school refuses your child a place because admitting them would breach this limit, then your appeal will be an infant class size appeal. This is different from all other school admission appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn an infant class size appeal, a panel will only uphold the appeal where:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit finds that the admission of an additional child would not breach the infant class size limit\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eif it finds that the school’s admission arrangements were unlawful, or had not been properly applied, and the child would have been offered a place at the school if the arrangements were lawful or had been properly applied\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eit decides that the decision to refuse admission was not one, which a reasonable admission authority would have made in the circumstances of the case\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo find a decision to be unreasonable, the panel would need to be satisfied that the decision to refuse admission was ‘perverse in the light of the admission arrangements’ meaning that it was so irrational that no other reasonable admission authority would have come to the same decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA decision that makes it impossible for you to transport all your children to school on time is unlikely to be perverse. However, a decision to refuse a place to a child, whose family had to relocate under a witness protection scheme, might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe threshold for finding that an admission authority’s decision to refuse admission was unreasonable is high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, it’s unlikely that they would uphold the appeal on that basis. It’s important that parents recognise this before investing what can be a significant amount of time and effort, in an infant class size appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you make your decision to appeal, you should think carefully about your reasons for appeal and be realistic about the likely outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"after-the-appeal-hearing\"\u003eAfter the appeal hearing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk will normally write to you within 5 school days to notify you of the panel’s decision.

The clerk should inform you if that is the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision of the appeal panel is binding and only the courts, by way of a judicial review, can overturn a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the panel uphold your appeal, the admission authority must admit your child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the panel do not uphold your appeal, you still have a number of options you may wish to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"waiting-lists\"\u003eWaiting lists\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdmission authorities must operate a waiting list for at least the first term of each school year of admission.
