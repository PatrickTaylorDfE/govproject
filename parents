	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>This advice is for parents whose child has been refused a place at a school for which they have applied, and who may be considering appealing the decision to refuse admission.</p>
	
	<p>It provides information about what you should consider before making the decision to appeal, how you can exercise your right of appeal and what you can expect at each stage of the appeals process.</p>
	
	<h2 id="your-right-of-appeal">Your right of appeal</h2>
	
	<p>If your child has been refused a place at any school for which you have applied, you have the right to appeal this decision. However, if your child has been permanently excluded from 2 or more schools within the past 2 years, the admission authority is not required to make arrangements for your appeal.</p>
	
	<p>You can only appeal once for a place in the same school, in the same academic year, unless, as a result of a significant change in your circumstances, the admission authority has accepted a second application from you and it has also been refused.</p>
	
	<p>If your child has an Education Health &amp; Care Plan (EHC Plan) which names a school, that school must admit your child. If the school named in the EHC plan is refusing to admit your child, the local authority can ask the Secretary of State for Education to determine whether the school’s governing body is failing to carry out its statutory duties and whether to use his powers under the Education Act 1996 to direct the school to admit. If you are unhappy with the school, which has been named in the EHC plan, you may appeal to the <a href="www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-special-educational-needs-and-disability">First-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs &amp; Disability)</a>.</p>
	
	<h2 id="things-you-should-consider-before-you-decide-to-appeal">Things you should consider before you decide to appeal</h2>
	
	<p>Before you decide to appeal, it is important that you consider any advice that you receive about the appeals process, including the information set out in this document. An appeal can prolong the process of securing a school place for your child, so it is important to be realistic about your reasons for appealing and the chances of being successful. This is particularly the case if you are appealing a decision to refuse admission to an infant class, such as a reception class, where the law prevents a school from admitting more than 30 pupils, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>
	
	<p>It will be helpful for you to understand how places at the school are allocated, so that you can understand why your child was not offered a place.</p>
	
	<h2 id="how-school-places-are-allocated">How school places are allocated</h2>
	
	<p>Admission arrangements for individual schools are set and applied locally. It is the role of the school’s admission authority to decide what admissions criteria to set, as long as they comply with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">School Admissions Code</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The admission authority for a community or voluntary controlled school is the local authority. For a foundation or voluntary aided school, it is the school’s governing body and for academies and free schools, it is the academy trust.</p>
	
	<p>Admissions criteria set out the priority order in which places will be allocated when there are more applicants than places. The admission authority must allocate places at the school in accordance with these published criteria. They can usually be found on schools’ or local authorities’ websites.</p>
	
	<h2 id="why-your-child-was-not-offered-a-school-place">Why your child was not offered a school place</h2>
	
	<p>The appeals process can be a burdensome process for schools, so admission authorities do not take lightly the decision to refuse a child a school place. The reason why your child was refused a place at a school for which you applied should be set out in your admissions decision letter. If it is not clear why your child was refused a place, you may wish to contact the admission authority to find out why. Contact details of where you can direct any queries can be found on your decision letter.</p>
	
	<p>In the normal admissions round, it is likely that your child was refused a place because all the available places were offered to those who met the school’s higher priority admissions criteria.</p>
	
	<p>If you made an in-year application, i.e. outside the normal points of admission, typically at reception and year 7, it is likely that your child was not offered a place because the year group you applied for is full and the school cannot admit any further children. Admission authorities are also able to refuse in-year applications on the basis that a child has challenging behaviour, which the school is unable to accommodate. Where this is the case, the admission authority will refer the child to the local authority so that a more suitable school place can be identified through a process known as the Fair Access Protocol.</p>
	
	<h2 id="the-appeals-process">The appeals process</h2>
	
	<p>You will receive a letter to tell you that you have been refused a place for your child at your preferred school. This letter will explain how you can appeal this decision.</p>
	
	<p>First, you will need to set out your grounds for appeal in writing. Appeals should be made to the admission authority of the school, who should allow you at least 20 school days to prepare and lodge your written appeal.</p>
	
	<p>If you are not able to submit all the information and supporting evidence you want to at the time you lodge your appeal (e.g. information to demonstrate that the school is able to admit additional children), it is important you do so by the deadline set for this. It needs to be circulated to the panel and admission authority, who will need time to consider it before the hearing. If you submit anything after the deadline, it may not be considered by the panel or may result in delays to your hearing.</p>
	
	<p>Once you have lodged an appeal, the clerk to the panel will let you know the time, date and location of your appeal hearing. They will give you at least 10 school days’ notice, unless you have let them know you do not need this much notice.</p>
	
	<h3 id="what-happens-at-an-appeal-hearing">What happens at an appeal hearing?</h3>
	
	<p>It is important you understand what will happen at the hearing, so that you can be prepared. The clerk, responsible for all the administrative arrangements for the appeal, will explain everything that will happen on the day of and after your hearing. They will also be available to provide independent advice on the appeals process and any queries you may have.</p>
	
	<p>You will present your case in front of an appeal panel, which is usually made up of 3 people. A representative of the admission authority will also be there to present the school’s case to the panel. They are usually referred to as the presenting officer and there can be more than 1 representative present. The panel will then make the decision on whether to uphold or dismiss an appeal.</p>
	
	<h3 id="standard-appeal-hearings">Standard appeal hearings</h3>
	
	<h4 id="stage-1--the-schools-case-for-refusing-admission">Stage 1 – The school’s case for refusing admission</h4>
	
	<p>First, the school’s presenting officer will be given the opportunity to set out the school’s case as to why they cannot admit any more children. This will be your opportunity to ask questions and challenge the presenting officer about why the school cannot admit more children. If more than 1 appeal is received for the same school, for the same year group, then this stage will normally be heard in front of all the appellants (usually the parents) together.</p>
	
	<p>Once the presenting officer has presented the school’s case, all the appellants, and the presenting officer, will be asked to leave the room so that the panel can make a decision on whether to uphold your appeal at this stage or whether to proceed onto Stage 2.</p>
	
	<p>Appeals can only be upheld at Stage 1 of the appeal if the panel finds that:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the school’s admission arrangements were unlawful and/or were not applied properly in your child’s case and that your child would have been offered a place if they were lawful/correctly applied</li>
	<li>admitting another child at the school would not negatively affect the delivery of education or the education of the other children already admitted at the school</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If your appeal is not upheld at this stage, then the panel will proceed onto Stage 2.</p>
	
	<h4 id="stage-2--parents-case-for-appeal">Stage 2 – Parents’ case for appeal</h4>
	
	<p>If the appeal proceeds to Stage 2, you will be invited to present your case to the panel. You will need to explain why you believe your child should be admitted to the school. The panel and the presenting officer may ask you questions about your case. This stage is likely to take around 20 to 60 minutes; you may request more time if you need it. You should be aware that if you present new information or evidence, that you have not previously submitted in writing, at the hearing, the panel might not consider it.</p>
	
	<p>After you have presented your case, you and the presenting officer will be asked to leave the room. The panel will discuss and make a decision on whether to uphold or dismiss your appeal, having balanced your case for wanting your child to attend the school, against the school’s arguments for not being able to admit another child. The panel will uphold your appeal if it finds that your case outweighs the case put forward by the school.</p>
	
	<h3 id="multiple-appeals">Multiple appeals</h3>
	
	<p>If the admission authority receives a number of appeals, they may be heard as a group. The presenting officer’s case will normally be heard in front of all the appellants together. However, each appellant’s case will be heard individually, without the presence of the other appellants. You will only have to present your case to the panel and the presenting officer. If there are a significant number of appeals to be heard, you might not present your case on the same day as the presenting officer. The clerk will notify you of the exact timings of your appeal.</p>
	
	<h3 id="your-case-for-appeal">Your case for appeal</h3>
	
	<p>The grounds on which you can appeal are not limited. However, is important that both your written appeal and the case that you present at the hearing is as robust as possible.</p>
	
	<p>Grounds for appeal can be that you simply want your child to attend a particular school, over any other, but the stronger your reasons, the more likely it is that your appeal will be upheld. For example, reasons such as the school being the best in the area is not likely to convince the panel that your child should be granted a place at the school. You should focus on any particular needs that your child has which can best be met by that school in particular, including what the school can offer that others cannot.</p>
	
	<p>Other grounds for appeal might be that you believe that the admission authority did not apply their admission arrangements properly in your child’s case and your child would have been offered a school place if they were.</p>
	
	<h2 id="appeals-for-different-school-types">Appeals for different school types</h2>
	
	<h3 id="appeals-for-grammar-schools">Appeals for grammar schools</h3>
	
	<p>If your child passes the entrance test but could not be offered a place because all the places were offered to those who more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the appeals process will be the same as all other school admission appeals.</p>
	
	<p>However, if your child did not pass the entrance test, then the panel will consider your appeal differently. In such cases, the panel will only uphold the appeal if they are satisfied that your child meets the required academic standards and is suitable for a grammar school education. You may be able to demonstrate this by providing school reports and references from your child’s current or previous school that indicate that your child is of grammar school ability. The panel may also consider any circumstances that may have prevented your child performing well on the day of the exam, for example, because they were feeling unwell. The panel will decide if these factors would have affected the outcome of the test.</p>
	
	<p>Before making the decision to refuse admission, some admission authorities will hold a local review to consider whether a child who failed the test ought to be considered to be of grammar school ability. Where a local review has taken place, the appeal panel will only consider whether the review was carried out in a fair, consistent and objective way. It will not carry out the review process again.</p>
	
	<h3 id="appeals-for-boarding-schools">Appeals for boarding schools</h3>
	
	<p>If your child has been refused admission to a boarding school because all the places available were offered to those who more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the appeals process will be the same as all other school admission appeals.</p>
	
	<p>If your child has been refused admission because the admission authority decided they were ‘unsuitable to board’, the panel will consider whether this decision was reasonable in the light of the available information. They will not carry out their own assessment of whether your child is suitable to board.</p>
	
	<h3 id="appeals-for-admission-to-school-sixth-forms">Appeals for admission to school sixth forms</h3>
	
	<p>As well as their parents, young people who have been refused a place at a school sixth form also have the right to appeal against the refusal of a school place. If they were refused admission because places were offered to those who more closely met the school’s admission criteria, then the appeals process will be the same as all other school admission appeals.</p>
	
	<p>If an applicant was refused a school place because they did not meet the specified entry requirements (e.g. a specified number of GCSEs at particular grades), then the panel will only uphold the appeal if it considers that the admission authority’s decision was unreasonable in light of the information provided. For example, if there were particular circumstances which may have affected the number of GCSEs passed at the relevant grades.</p>
	
	<h2 id="infant-class-size-appeals">Infant class size appeals</h2>
	
	<p>The law limits the size of an infant class (reception year and years 1 &amp; 2) to a maximum of 30 pupils per teacher. If your child was refused admission because admitting them would breach this limit, then your appeal will be held as an infant class size appeal. This is different from all other school admission appeals.</p>
	
	<p>In an infant class size appeal, a panel can only uphold the appeal where:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>it finds that the admission of an additional child would not breach the infant class size limit</li>
	<li>if it finds that the school’s admission arrangements were unlawful, or had not been properly applied, and the child would have been offered a place at the school if the arrangements were lawful or had been properly applied</li>
	<li>it decides that the decision to refuse admission was not one, which a reasonable admission authority would have made in the circumstances of the case</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To find a decision to be unreasonable, the panel would need to be satisfied that the decision to refuse admission was ‘perverse in the light of the admission arrangements,’ meaning that it was so irrational that no other reasonable admission authority would have come to the same decision. A decision that makes it impossible for you to transport all your children to school on time is very unlikely to be perverse. However, a decision to refuse a place to a child, whose family had to relocate under a witness protection scheme, might be decided by a panel to be perverse.</p>
	
	<p>The threshold for finding that an admission authority’s decision to refuse admission was unreasonable is very high. Consequently, the likelihood of an infant class size appeal being upheld on that basis is extremely low. It is important that parents recognise this before investing what can be a significant amount of time and effort, in an infant class size appeal.</p>
	
	<p>Before you make your decision to appeal, you should think carefully about your reasons for appeal and be realistic about the likelihood of your appeal being upheld.</p>
	
	<h2 id="after-the-appeal-hearing">After the appeal hearing</h2>
	
	<p>The clerk will normally write to you within 5 school days to notify you of the panel’s decision. If the panel is hearing a large number of appeals, this may delay the notification letter. The clerk should inform you if that is the case.</p>
	
	<p>The decision of the appeal panel is binding and can only be overturned by the Courts by way of a Judicial Review.</p>
	
	<p>If your appeal is upheld, the admission authority must admit your child.</p>
	
	<p>If your appeal is not upheld, you still have a number of options you may wish to consider. These are set out below.</p>
	
	<h3 id="waiting-lists">Waiting lists</h3>
	
	<p>Admission authorities must operate a waiting list for at least the first term of each school year of admission. If your appeal is not upheld, and if you have not already done so, you may wish to put your child’s name on the school’s waiting list. Even after all the places have been allocated at the school, it is possible that a place could still become available. Places will be allocated in accordance with the school’s published admissions criteria.</p>
	
	<h3 id="seeking-an-alternative-school-place">Seeking an alternative school place</h3>
	
	<p>It is your responsibility to secure a suitable education for your child. If your child is without a school place, you may wish to contact your local authority who will be able to advise you of other vacancies available in the area.</p>
	
	<h3 id="complaints-about-appeals">Complaints about appeals</h3>
	
	<p>If your appeal was not upheld and you think that the admission authority or the appeal panel has acted incorrectly, you may make a complaint of maladministration.</p>
	
	<p>Any such complaint must relate to issues such as failure to follow correct procedure or failure to act independently or fairly. You cannot complain simply because you do not agree with the panel’s decision. The body you should complain to depends on the type of school you appealed for.</p>
	
	<p>If you wish to make a complaint against an appeal panel for a school maintained by your local authority, you should do so to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.lgo.org.uk">Local Government Ombudsman</a>.</p>

	
	<p>If you wish to make a complaint against an appeal panel for an academy, you should do so to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions/appealing-a-schools-decision">Education Skills and Funding Agency</a>.</p>

However, if your child has been permanently excluded from 2 or more schools within the past 2 years, the admission authority is not required to make arrangements for your appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can only appeal once for a place in the same school, in the same academic year, unless, as a result of a significant change in your circumstances, the admission authority has accepted a second application from you and it has also been refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child has an Education Health \u0026amp; Care Plan (EHC Plan) which names a school, that school must admit your child. If the school named in the EHC plan is refusing to admit your child, the local authority can ask the Secretary of State for Education to determine whether the school’s governing body is failing to carry out its statutory duties and whether to use his powers under the Education Act 1996 to direct the school to admit. If you are unhappy with the school, which has been named in the EHC plan, you may appeal to the \u003ca href=\"www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-special-educational-needs-and-disability\"\u003eFirst-tier Tribunal (Special Educational Needs \u0026amp; Disability)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"things-you-should-consider-before-you-decide-to-appeal\"\u003eThings you should consider before you decide to appeal\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you decide to appeal, it is important that you consider any advice that you receive about the appeals process, including the information set out in this document. An appeal can prolong the process of securing a school place for your child, so it is important to be realistic about your reasons for appealing and the chances of being successful. This is particularly the case if you are appealing a decision to refuse admission to an infant class, such as a reception class, where the law prevents a school from admitting more than 30 pupils, other than in exceptional circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be helpful for you to understand how places at the school are allocated, so that you can understand why your child was not offered a place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-school-places-are-allocated\"\u003eHow school places are allocated\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdmission arrangements for individual schools are set and applied locally. It is the role of the school’s admission authority to decide what admissions criteria to set, as long as they comply with the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2\"\u003eSchool Admissions Code\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe admission authority for a community or voluntary controlled school is the local authority. For a foundation or voluntary aided school, it is the school’s governing body and for academies and free schools, it is the academy trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdmissions criteria set out the priority order in which places will be allocated when there are more applicants than places. The admission authority must allocate places at the school in accordance with these published criteria. They can usually be found on schools’ or local authorities’ websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-your-child-was-not-offered-a-school-place\"\u003eWhy your child was not offered a school place\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe appeals process can be a burdensome process for schools, so admission authorities do not take lightly the decision to refuse a child a school place. The reason why your child was refused a place at a school for which you applied should be set out in your admissions decision letter. If it is not clear why your child was refused a place, you may wish to contact the admission authority to find out why. Contact details of where you can direct any queries can be found on your decision letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the normal admissions round, it is likely that your child was refused a place because all the available places were offered to those who met the school’s higher priority admissions criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you made an in-year application, i.e. outside the normal points of admission, typically at reception and year 7, it is likely that your child was not offered a place because the year group you applied for is full and the school cannot admit any further children. Admission authorities are also able to refuse in-year applications on the basis that a child has challenging behaviour, which the school is unable to accommodate. Where this is the case, the admission authority will refer the child to the local authority so that a more suitable school place can be identified through a process known as the Fair Access Protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-appeals-process\"\u003eThe appeals process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will receive a letter to tell you that you have been refused a place for your child at your preferred school. This letter will explain how you can appeal this decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, you will need to set out your grounds for appeal in writing. Appeals should be made to the admission authority of the school, who should allow you at least 20 school days to prepare and lodge your written appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are not able to submit all the information and supporting evidence you want to at the time you lodge your appeal (e.g. information to demonstrate that the school is able to admit additional children), it is important you do so by the deadline set for this. It needs to be circulated to the panel and admission authority, who will need time to consider it before the hearing. If you submit anything after the deadline, it may not be considered by the panel or may result in delays to your hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you have lodged an appeal, the clerk to the panel will let you know the time, date and location of your appeal hearing. They will give you at least 10 school days’ notice, unless you have let them know you do not need this much notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-happens-at-an-appeal-hearing\"\u003eWhat happens at an appeal hearing?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important you understand what will happen at the hearing, so that you can be prepared. The clerk, responsible for all the administrative arrangements for the appeal, will explain everything that will happen on the day of and after your hearing. They will also be available to provide independent advice on the appeals process and any queries you may have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will present your case in front of an appeal panel, which is usually made up of 3 people. A representative of the admission authority will also be there to present the school’s case to the panel. They are usually referred to as the presenting officer and there can be more than 1 representative present. The panel will then make the decision on whether to uphold or dismiss an appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"standard-appeal-hearings\"\u003eStandard appeal hearings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"stage-1--the-schools-case-for-refusing-admission\"\u003eStage 1 – The school’s case for refusing admission\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the school’s presenting officer will be given the opportunity to set out the school’s case as to why they cannot admit any more children. This will be your opportunity to ask questions and challenge the presenting officer about why the school cannot admit more children. If more than 1 appeal is received for the same school, for the same year group, then this stage will normally be heard in front of all the appellants (usually the parents) together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the presenting officer has presented the school’s case, all the appellants, and the presenting officer, will be asked to leave the room so that the panel can make a decision on whether to uphold your appeal at this stage or whether to proceed onto Stage 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAppeals can only be upheld at Stage 1 of the appeal if the panel finds that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n \u003cli\u003ethe school’s admission arrangements were unlawful and/or were not applied properly in your child’s case and that your child would have been offered a place if they were lawful/correctly applied\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eadmitting another child at the school would not negatively affect the delivery of education or the education of the other children already admitted at the school\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your appeal is not upheld at this stage, then the panel will proceed onto Stage 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 id=\"stage-2--parents-case-for-appeal\"\u003eStage 2 – Parents’ case for appeal\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the appeal proceeds to Stage 2, you will be invited to present your case to the panel. You will need to explain why you believe your child should be admitted to the school. The panel and the presenting officer may ask you questions about your case. This stage is likely to take around 20 to 60 minutes; you may request more time if you need it. You should be aware that if you present new information or evidence, that you have not previously submitted in writing, at the hearing, the panel might not consider it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter you have presented your case, you and the presenting officer will be asked to leave the room. The panel will discuss and make a decision on whether to uphold or dismiss your appeal, having balanced your case for wanting your child to attend the school, against the school’s arguments for not being able to admit another child. The panel will uphold your appeal if it finds that your case outweighs the case put forward by the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"multiple-appeals\"\u003eMultiple appeals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf the admission authority receives a number of appeals, they may be heard as a group. The presenting officer’s case will normally be heard in front of all the appellants together. However, each appellant’s case will be heard individually, without the presence of the other appellants. You will only have to present your case to the panel and the presenting officer. If there are a significant number of appeals to be heard, you might not present your case on the same day as the presenting officer. The clerk will notify you of the exact timings of your appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"your-case-for-appeal\"\u003eYour case for appeal\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe grounds on which you can appeal are not limited. However, is important that both your written appeal and the case that you present at the hearing is as robust as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGrounds for appeal can be that you simply want your child to attend a particular school, over any other, but the stronger your reasons, the more likely it is that your appeal will be upheld. For example, reasons such as the school being the best in the area is not likely to convince the panel that your child should be granted a place at the school. You should focus on any particular needs that your child has which can best be met by that school in particular, including what the school can offer that others cannot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOther grounds for appeal might be that you believe that the admission authority did not apply their admission arrangements properly in your child’s case and your child would have been offered a school place if they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"appeals-for-different-school-types\"\u003eAppeals for different school types\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"appeals-for-grammar-schools\"\u003eAppeals for grammar schools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child passes the entrance test but could not be offered a place because all the places were offered to those who more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the appeals process will be the same as all other school admission appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if your child did not pass the entrance test, then the panel will consider your appeal differently. In such cases, the panel will only uphold the appeal if they are satisfied that your child meets the required academic standards and is suitable for a grammar school education. You may be able to demonstrate this by providing school reports and references from your child’s current or previous school that indicate that your child is of grammar school ability. The panel may also consider any circumstances that may have prevented your child performing well on the day of the exam, for example, because they were feeling unwell. The panel will decide if these factors would have affected the outcome of the test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore making the decision to refuse admission, some admission authorities will hold a local review to consider whether a child who failed the test ought to be considered to be of grammar school ability. Where a local review has taken place, the appeal panel will only consider whether the review was carried out in a fair, consistent and objective way. It will not carry out the review process again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"appeals-for-boarding-schools\"\u003eAppeals for boarding schools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child has been refused admission to a boarding school because all the places available were offered to those who more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the appeals process will be the same as all other school admission appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your child has been refused admission because the admission authority decided they were ‘unsuitable to board’, the panel will consider whether this decision was reasonable in the light of the available information. They will not carry out their own assessment of whether your child is suitable to board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"appeals-for-admission-to-school-sixth-forms\"\u003eAppeals for admission to school sixth forms\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as their parents, young people who have been refused a place at a school sixth form also have the right to appeal against the refusal of a school place. If they were refused admission because places were offered to those who more closely met the school’s admission criteria, then the appeals process will be the same as all other school admission appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf an applicant was refused a school place because they did not meet the specified entry requirements (e.g. a specified number of GCSEs at particular grades), then the panel will only uphold the appeal if it considers that the admission authority’s decision was unreasonable in light of the information provided. For example, if there were particular circumstances which may have affected the number of GCSEs passed at the relevant grades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"infant-class-size-appeals\"\u003eInfant class size appeals\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe law limits the size of an infant class (reception year and years 1 \u0026amp; 2) to a maximum of 30 pupils per teacher. If your child was refused admission because admitting them would breach this limit, then your appeal will be held as an infant class size appeal. This is different from all other school admission appeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn an infant class size appeal, a panel can only uphold the appeal where:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eit finds that the admission of an additional child would not breach the infant class size limit\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eif it finds that the school’s admission arrangements were unlawful, or had not been properly applied, and the child would have been offered a place at the school if the arrangements were lawful or had been properly applied\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eit decides that the decision to refuse admission was not one, which a reasonable admission authority would have made in the circumstances of the case\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo find a decision to be unreasonable, the panel would need to be satisfied that the decision to refuse admission was ‘perverse in the light of the admission arrangements,’ meaning that it was so irrational that no other reasonable admission authority would have come to the same decision. A decision that makes it impossible for you to transport all your children to school on time is very unlikely to be perverse. However, a decision to refuse a place to a child, whose family had to relocate under a witness protection scheme, might be decided by a panel to be perverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe threshold for finding that an admission authority’s decision to refuse admission was unreasonable is very high. Consequently, the likelihood of an infant class size appeal being upheld on that basis is extremely low. It is important that parents recognise this before investing what can be a significant amount of time and effort, in an infant class size appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you make your decision to appeal, you should think carefully about your reasons for appeal and be realistic about the likelihood of your appeal being upheld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"after-the-appeal-hearing\"\u003eAfter the appeal hearing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk will normally write to you within 5 school days to notify you of the panel’s decision. If the panel is hearing a large number of appeals, this may delay the notification letter. The clerk should inform you if that is the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision of the appeal panel is binding and can only be overturned by the Courts by way of a Judicial Review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your appeal is upheld, the admission authority must admit your child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your appeal is not upheld, you still have a number of options you may wish to consider. These are set out below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"waiting-lists\"\u003eWaiting lists\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdmission authorities must operate a waiting list for at least the first term of each school year of admission. If your appeal is not upheld, and if you have not already done so, you may wish to put your child’s name on the school’s waiting list. Even after all the places have been allocated at the school, it is possible that a place could still become available. Places will be allocated in accordance with the school’s published admissions criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"seeking-an-alternative-school-place\"\u003eSeeking an alternative school place\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is your responsibility to secure a suitable education for your child. If your child is without a school place, you may wish to contact your local authority who will be able to advise you of other vacancies available in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"complaints-about-appeals\"\u003eComplaints about appeals\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf your appeal was not upheld and you think that the admission authority or the appeal panel has acted incorrectly, you may make a complaint of maladministration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAny such complaint must relate to issues such as failure to follow correct procedure or failure to act independently or fairly. You cannot complain simply because you do not agree with the panel’s decision. The body you should complain to depends on the type of school you appealed for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you wish to make a complaint against an appeal panel for a school maintained by your local authority, you should do so to the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.lgo.org.uk\"\u003eLocal Government Ombudsman\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you wish to make a complaint against an appeal panel for an academy, you should do so to the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions/appealing-a-schools-decision\"\u003eEducation Skills and Funding Agency\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"}
