	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>This advice is for school admission authorities. It provides information about how admission authorities can fulfil their duties in relation to setting up independent appeal panels and ensuring they are properly trained so that school admission appeals can be heard in a fair, transparent and consistent manner.</p>
	
	<p>It also provides information as to how admission authorities can present their case to the appeal panel, and the type of evidence panels may wish to see, in order to establish if prejudice will occur should an additional child be admitted to the school.</p>
	
	<p>This advice should be read in conjunction with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">School Admission Appeals Code</a>, the <a rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">School Admissions Code</a> and other law that affects admissions and admission appeals in England.</p>
	
	<h2 id="informing-parents-about-their-right-of-appeal">Informing parents about their right of appeal</h2>
	
	<p>Parents refused a place at a school for which they have applied have the right to appeal to an independent appeal panel. This includes where a child is in the process of, or has already been allocated, an alternative school place via the local Fair Access Protocol or otherwise.</p>
	
	<p>When informing parents of a decision to refuse a place at a school for which they have applied, admission authorities must include a reason as to why admission was refused. At the same time, they must also provide parents with information about how they can appeal this decision, including:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>that the reasons for appeal must be set out in writing</li>
	<li>a deadline for lodging an appeal</li>
	<li>contact details about where the appeal can be submitted</li>
	<li>information on the limited circumstances in which an infant class size appeal can be upheld, if admission was refused due to the restriction on infant class sizes</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="making-arrangements-to-organise-and-hear-appeals">Making arrangements to organise and hear appeals</h2>
	
	<p>It is the responsibility of the admission authority of the school to make arrangements for appeals against the refusal of a place at their school. For community and voluntary controlled schools, this responsibility rests with the local authority. For foundation and voluntary aided schools, the responsibility rests with the governing body and for academies, it rests with the academy trust.</p>
	
	<p>Schools, which are their own admission authority, can do this in one of the following ways:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>by establishing their own independent appeals panel</li>
	<li>by making joint arrangements for hearing appeals with other admission authorities in the area</li>
	<li>by using the appeals service provided by the local authority (there may be a charge for this)</li>
	<li>by contracting the process out to a commercial organisation running appeals for schools (there will be a charge for this)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Ultimately, however, admission authorities remain responsible for ensuring that the appeals function for their school is carried out effectively and in accordance with statutory requirements.</p>
	
	<h2 id="setting-up-the-independent-appeal-panel">Setting up the independent appeal panel</h2>
	
	<p>Admission authorities must appoint a clerk to the appeal panel, who must be independent of the school and the education functions of the local authority. The clerk must have knowledge of both the School Admissions Code and the School Admission Appeals Code and other law relating to admissions, including equalities legislation.</p>
	
	<p>Admission authorities must also appoint an independent appeal panel, which must be comprised of a chair and at least two panel members, of which one is:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a lay person (someone without personal experience of managing a school or the provision of education in a school)</li>
	<li>someone with experience in education and who is acquainted with the educational conditions in the local area, or who is a parent of a registered pupil in a school.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Admission authorities must ensure that panel members are selected on the basis of being able to make fair and objective decisions. Panel members for appeals for a school with a religious designation must not be selected solely on the basis of their faith. It is important that panel members are independent and retain their independence at all times.</p>
	
	<p>The following persons must not be appointed as a panel member, as holding such a post may raise doubts about impartiality:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>an employee from the local authority which is the admission authority of the school or whose area the school is located</li>
	<li>a member or former member of the governing body, or the Academy Trust or Multi Academy Trust, of the school in question</li>
	<li>a teacher or teaching assistant at the school in question</li>
	<li>any person who has been involved in the decision making of refusing admission to the school in question</li>
	<li>any person who has had any connection with the local authority, the school, the Academy Trust, or Multi Academy Trust, if the school in question is an academy, or any of the above, which may raise doubts as to their impartiality</li>
	<li>any person who has not had the relevant training to hear school admission appeals</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
	
	<p>Admission authorities must ensure clerks and panel members are appropriately trained before taking part in any part of the appeals process. As a minimum, they must arrange and fund appropriate training on:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the law relating to school admissions and admission appeals</li>
	<li>members’ duties under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Equalities Act 2010</li>
	<li>procedural fairness and natural justice</li>
	<li>the specific roles of particular members i.e. clerking and chairing skills</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It is important that appeal panels are set up correctly and with the appropriate training. Failure to do so could result in further complaints, which may require appeals to be reheard.</p>
	
	<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
	
	<p>Local authorities must treat maintained schools, and schools which are their own admission authority, equitably in relation to centrally retained Dedicated Schools Grant funding. This means that if local authorities use centrally held funding to provide a free admission appeals service for community and voluntary controlled schools, they must also provide this service free to academies, voluntary aided schools and foundation schools.</p>
	
	<p>Alternatively, where local authorities delegate funding for appeals to all schools in their individual budgets, they may charge the budgets of their maintained schools for the costs associated with administering admissions appeals on their behalf. Academies, voluntary aided schools and foundation schools may also wish to buy into the appeals services provided by the local authority or can make alternative arrangements.</p>
	
	<h2 id="appeals-timetable">Appeals timetable</h2>
	
	<p>By 28 February each year, admission authorities must set out on their website a timetable for organising and hearing appeals that:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>includes a deadline for lodging appeals, which allows appellants at least 20 school days from the date of notification that their application was unsuccessful to prepare and lodge their written appeal</li>
	<li>ensures that appellants receive written notification of the date and arrangements of their hearing, at least 10 school days before their hearing</li>
	<li>includes reasonable deadlines for appellants to submit additional evidence not submitted with the initial appeal, for admission authorities to submit their evidence, and for the clerk to send the appeal papers to the panel and parties</li>
	<li>ensures that decision letters are sent within 5 school days of the hearing wherever possible</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Admission authorities must ensure that appeals lodged on time are heard within the following timescales:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>for applications made in the normal admissions round, appeals must be heard within 40 school days from the deadline for lodging appeals</li>
	<li>for late applications, appeals should be heard with 40 school days from the deadline for lodging appeals, or within 30 school days of the appeal being lodged</li>
	<li>for applications to sixth form where the offer of a place would have been conditional upon exam results, appeals must be heard within 30 school days of confirmation of those results</li>
	<li>for applications to sixth form where the offer of a place would not have been conditional upon exam results, appeals must be heard within 40 school days of the deadline for lodging appeals</li>
	<li>for applications made in year, appeals must be heard within 30 school days of the appeal being lodged</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Appeals submitted after the appropriate deadline must still be heard and a timescale for hearing such appeals should be set out in the published appeals timetable.</p>
	
	<h2 id="the-appeal-hearing">The appeal hearing</h2>
	
	<p>Where admission authorities are making their own arrangements for setting up and hearing appeals, they must ensure the following are in place for the hearing:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>venues for hearings that are appropriate and accessible to appellants</li>
	<li>suitable waiting areas for appellants and presenting officers to wait separately from the panel before and between appeals</li>
	<li>appeal hearings are held in private, and are conducted in the presence of all panel members and parties (appellants and their representatives, and school presenting officers)</li>
	<li>that the same panel hears multiple appeals for a school, as far as reasonably possible</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="notes-and-records-of-proceedings">Notes and records of proceedings</h3>
	
	<p>It is admission authorities’ responsibility to ensure that notes and records of proceedings are kept securely for a minimum of two years.</p>
	
	<h2 id="the-role-of-the-admission-authority-during-an-appeal">The role of the admission authority during an appeal</h2>
	
	<p>Once an independent appeal panel is in place, the admission authority’s role is to demonstrate to that panel why the school cannot admit any more children and how doing so would prejudice the quality of education provided by the school and the use of its resources.</p>
	
	<h3 id="presenting-officer">Presenting officer</h3>
	
	<p>The admission authority must provide a presenting officer to attend the hearing and present its reasons as to why it cannot admit more children. It is important that a member of staff who is well acquainted with the school carries out this role. It is likely that the panel will ask detailed and challenging questions about the case being heard, the characteristics of the school (e.g. school capacity, classroom sizes, the availability of staff etc.) and student body, and the admission authority’s reasons for refusing admission.</p>
	
	<h3 id="production-of-evidence">Production of evidence</h3>
	
	<p>The admission authority must supply the panel with all it needs to conduct the hearing in a fair and transparent manner. This includes supplying the clerk with all the relevant documents needed to conduct the hearing, within the timescales set out, including:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>details of the school’s admission arrangements</li>
	<li>how the admission arrangements and the co-ordinated admissions scheme were applied to the child in question</li>
	<li>the reasons for the decision to refuse admission</li>
	<li>an explanation as to how the admission of an additional child would cause prejudice to the provision of efficient education or efficient use of resources</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Admission authorities must comply with reasonable requests from parents for information, which they need to help them prepare for their appeal.</p>
	
	<h3 id="demonstrating-prejudice">Demonstrating prejudice</h3>
	
	<p>An appeal will be upheld unless the admission authority is able to put forward a robust case to demonstrate that admitting an additional child to the school would prejudice the provision of efficient education or efficient use of resources.</p>
	
	<p>This means admission authorities will have to demonstrate how admitting another child at the school will compromise the quality of education received by the existing pupils at the school, and the negative impact this will have on the school’s resources. Simply demonstrating that the school’s published admissions number has been reached will not be sufficient. In both their written statement and at the hearing, admission authorities must be able to demonstrate prejudice beyond the fact that the published admission number has already been reached.</p>
	
	<p>In cases where the admission authority has refused a child a school place, despite places being available, the admission authority must present its case for refusal, demonstrating how prejudice will occur despite the admission number not being met.</p>
	
	<p>Failing to demonstrate prejudice effectively will result in the admission authority losing the appeal and having to admit an additional pupil, or pupils, if the panel decides that it can accommodate them.</p>
	
	<h3 id="factors-considered-by-the-panel">Factors considered by the panel</h3>
	
	<p>In making their decisions, as to whether or not there would be prejudice, the panel will consider the following factors:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the effect an additional child would have on the school in the current and following academic years as the year group moves through the school</li>
	<li>whether any changes have been made to the school’s physical accommodation or organisation since the admission number was originally set for the relevant year group</li>
	<li>the impact on the organisation and size of classes, the availability of teaching staff, and the effect on children already at the school</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>As such, admission authorities should focus on presenting evidence to demonstrate these factors. In particular, this could include presenting evidence to demonstrate:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any pressures on staffing and their workloads</li>
	</ul>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p><em>For example:</em></p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the number of teaching and non-teaching staff and the impact additional children will have on their ability to deliver effective education</li>
	<li>the number of high needs children on roll and the impact this will have on both teaching and non-teaching staff, as well as the existing pupils at the school</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any restrictions in the school’s physical accommodation</li>
	</ul>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p><em>For example</em></p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>classroom sizes and the number of children they can accommodate</li>
	<li>size of shared spaces such as dining areas, assembly areas, sporting facilities, examination areas and the number of children they can accommodate</li>
	<li>any pressures on physical space which may result in health and safety concerns</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p>Any evidence must be specific to the school and the impact it will have on the school in delivering effective education. For example, the comparison of school data with national averages will not be sufficient in demonstrating prejudice will occur should an additional child be admitted to the school.</p>
	
	<p>Admission authorities should also avoid making speculative statements of future prejudice. For example, speculation about possible budget cuts or the reduction of staffing levels will not be sufficient in demonstrating prejudice.</p>
	
	<h2 id="further-appeals">Further appeals</h2>
	
	<p>If an appellant is unsuccessful in their appeal, they do not have the right to a second appeal for the same school place. However, appellants must be given the right to appeal, if the admission authority accepts another application for them, for whatever reason, and this is also refused.</p>
	
	<h3 id="further-complaints">Further complaints</h3>
	
	<p>If an appellant is unsuccessful in their appeal, admission authorities must inform them about the arrangements for making further complaints. Admission authorities should provide information about where complaints can be directed and the types of complaints that can be investigated, for example, in relation to complaints of maladministration.</p>
