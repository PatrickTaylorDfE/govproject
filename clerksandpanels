<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This advice is for admission appeal clerks and panel members.</p>

<p>It provides information about how clerks and panels can conduct their roles effectively, and in accordance with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">School Admissions Appeals Code</a> to ensure that appeal hearings are conducted in a fair, transparent and consistent manner.</p>

<p>You should read this in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">Appeals Code</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">School Admissions Code</a> and other laws that affect admissions and admission appeals in England.</p>

<h2 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and responsibilities</h2>

<h3 id="clerk-to-the-appeal-panel">Clerk to the appeal panel</h3>

<p>The clerk to an appeal panel must be independent of the school and the education functions of the local authority.</p>

<p>They must have knowledge of both the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">School Admissions Code</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">the School Admissions Appeals Code</a> and other law relating to admissions, including equalities legislation.</p>

<p>The role of the clerk is to make all the necessary administrative arrangements for the appeal.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>giving advice to the panel to enable it to carry out its judicial function</li>
  <li>responding to any queries from parents in advance of the appeal hearing and providing independent advice on the appeals process and admissions law when it is requested</li>
  <li>sending all the relevant papers required for the hearing to all the parties and informing them about the order of the proceedings in advance of the hearing</li>
  <li>keeping an accurate and comprehensive record of the proceedings, including the points raised at the hearing, attendance, voting and reasons for decisions</li>
  <li>sending written notification of the panel’s decision</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="appeal-panel">Appeal panel</h3>

<p>The appeal panel is the decision maker. The panel considers the case put forward by both the appellant and the school, and come to an independent conclusion as to whether the school should admit the child in question.</p>

<p>Appeal panels perform a judicial function, and must be independent, impartial and transparent in their decision-making at all times. They must not have a vested interest in the outcome of any stages of the appeal or be involved in an earlier stage of the proceedings, for example the decision to refuse admission.</p>

<p>The panel should be comprised of a chair and at least two other panel members, of which one is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lay person, someone without personal experience of managing a school or the provision of education in a school</li>
  <li>someone with experience in education and who is acquainted with the educational conditions in the local area, or who is the parent of a registered pupil in a school</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not appoint anybody as a panel member, whose involvement could raise doubts about impartiality.</p>

<p>This would include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employees of the local authority, school or trust</li>
  <li>a member or former member of the governing body</li>
  <li>a teacher or teaching assistant at the school</li>
  <li>a person involved in admission decisions at the school</li>
  <li>a person who has not had the relevant training to hear school admission appeals</li>
</ul>

<p>If a panel member has to be temporarily withdrawn, you must postpone the remaining hearings until the panel member returns.</p>

<p>If they’re unable to return, the admission authority must appoint a replacement and the new panel must rehear all appeals.</p>

<h2 id="before-the-hearing">Before the hearing</h2>

<p>The clerk must send all the papers required for the hearing to both parties and the panel members within a reasonable time before the hearing.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information about the order of proceedings</li>
  <li>information from the admission authority on how the admission arrangements and the coordinated admissions scheme apply to the appellant’s application</li>
  <li>the reasons for the decision to refuse admission and an explanation as to how admission of an additional child would cause prejudice to the provision of efficient education or efficient use of resources</li>
  <li>the parents’ written appeal</li>
  <li>names of the panel members</li>
  <li>any new information or evidence not submitted with the initial appeal</li>
</ul>

<p>The panel must decide whether they’ll take any information or evidence not submitted by the specified deadline into consideration. You need to take into account its significance and the effect of a possible need to adjourn the hearing.</p>

<p>The clerk should let relevant parties know before the hearing of any decision to reject any new information or evidence submitted after the specified deadline.</p>

<h2 id="the-appeal-hearing">The appeal hearing</h2>

<p>All panel members and parties must be present for the appeal hearing. The clerk must ensure that they do not leave either party alone with the panel.</p>

<p>The panel must give all parties a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the panel. The panel must not make any decisions until they’ve heard all the appeals.</p>

<p>Procedural errors are a key reason for complaints about maladministration and can result in the admission authority having to arrange a new hearing with a fresh panel. This is costly and time consuming.</p>

<p>Clerks and panels need to adhere to the following points to ensure they conduct appeals in a fair manner and to minimise the risk of maladministration.</p>

<h3 id="representation">Representation</h3>

<p>Appellants have the right to bring representation or a friend to accompany them. However, the panel must not allow the school’s representative to support an appeal for a place at their school, at either the hearing itself or by providing letters of support.</p>

<p>Where no presenting officer attends the hearing, the panel can decide to resolve the case by using the paper evidence submitted by the admission authority.</p>

<h3 id="introductions">Introductions</h3>

<p>At the start of the hearing, the chair of the panel should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>welcome everyone to the appeal, make introductions and keep a record of everyone in attendance</li>
  <li>introduce the order of proceedings</li>
  <li>confirm whether all the parties received all the appeal papers</li>
  <li>clarify that any new information presented at the hearing might not be taking into consideration by the panel</li>
</ul>

<p>If either party presents new information, the clerk should keep accurate records including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what this is</li>
  <li>whether it was accepted by the panel</li>
  <li>what weight was given to it</li>
</ul>

<p>The panel may wish to consider suggesting an adjournment if they need more time to consider the additional information.</p>

<p>Throughout the hearing, the clerk should also ensure they keep an accurate and comprehensive record of the proceedings.</p>

<p>This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>start and end times</li>
  <li>attendance</li>
  <li>all points raised at the hearing</li>
  <li>any adjournments and the reasons for these</li>
</ul>

<p>These will be a key source of evidence should parents raise further complaints of maladministration.</p>

<h2 id="stage-1--admission-authoritys-case">Stage 1 – Admission authority’s case</h2>

<p>The panel should provide the presenting officer with the opportunity to present the school’s case as to why it cannot admit any more children.</p>

<p>During this stage, the chair and/or panel should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the presenting officer has sufficient opportunity to present the school’s case without unreasonable interruption</li>
  <li>test and question the case put forward by the presenting officer, to ensure sufficient understanding of the issues</li>
  <li>ensure the appellant has the opportunity to ask the presenting officer any questions in relation to the school’s case</li>
  <li>explain the next stage of the process and how the panel will decide on whether to proceed to Stage 2 of the appeals process</li>
</ul>

<p>The clerk should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that they record all aspects of the school’s case in an accurate and comprehensive manner</li>
  <li>ensure any questions asked by the panel or the appellant and the subsequent responses are recorded accurately and fully</li>
  <li>share any concerns where the panel is defaulting on their duties under the Admissions or Appeals Code or other law relating to admissions, including equalities legislation</li>
  <li>make arrangements for the panel to consider the issues raised during this stage of the hearing in private and make its decision on whether to move to Stage 2 of the appeal</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="decision-making-process">Decision making process</h3>

<p>The panel must make its decision in private and in doing so must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the admission arrangements comply with the School Admissions Code and all other admissions law</li>
  <li>whether the admission arrangements were correctly and impartially applied in the child’s case</li>
  <li>whether the admission of an additional child would prejudice the provision of efficient education or the efficient use of resources</li>
</ul>

<p>This could include taking into consideration the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the school’s published admissions number (<abbr title="published admissions number">PAN</abbr>), however, exceeding <abbr title="published admissions number">PAN</abbr> does not always mean prejudice will occur</li>
  <li>changes to the school’s facilities</li>
  <li>the impact on the organisation and size of classes, the availability of teaching staff, and the effect on children already at the school</li>
  <li>the effect an additional pupil would have on the school both now and in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not the role of the panel, however, to reassess a school’s capacity.</p>

<p>The panel must uphold the appeal at this stage where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it finds that the admission arrangements were not lawful or that the admission arrangements were not correctly and impartially applied in the child’s case and the child would have been offered a place had the arrangements been lawful or were correctly and impartially applied</li>
  <li>it finds that the admission of an additional child would not prejudice the provision of efficient education or the efficient use of resources</li>
</ul>

<p>If the panel is unable to uphold the appeal at the first stage, it must proceed to the second stage of the appeal.</p>

<p>Once the panel has made its decision, the clerk should inform the parties about whether the panel will proceed to Stage 2 of the appeals process.</p>

<h2 id="stage-2--appellants-case-for-appeal">Stage 2 – Appellant’s case for appeal</h2>

<p>At Stage 2 of the appeal, the panel must provide the appellant the opportunity to set out why they believe their child should attend their preferred school.</p>

<p>You must ensure that appellants have the same opportunity to present their case as the school’s presenting officer.</p>

<p>The chair or panel should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the appellant feels as comfortable as possible</li>
  <li>ensure the appellant has sufficient opportunity to present their case, without unreasonable interruption</li>
  <li>test and question the case put forward by the appellant, to ensure sufficient understanding of the issues</li>
  <li>provide the presenting officer the opportunity to ask the appellant any questions in relation to their case</li>
  <li>explain the next stage of the process</li>
  <li>when appellants are likely to be notified of the outcome of the appeal</li>
</ul>

<p>The clerk should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure they record all aspects of the appellant’s case in an accurate and comprehensive manner</li>
  <li>ensure they record any questions by the panel or the presenting officer and the subsequent responses accurately and fully</li>
  <li>share any concerns where the panel may be defaulting on their duties under the Admissions or Appeals Code or other law relating to admissions, including equalities legislation</li>
  <li>make arrangements to enable the panel to balance the arguments put forward by the appellant and the presenting officer in private</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-decision-making-process">The decision making process</h3>

<p>Having heard both cases, the panel must balance the arguments put forward by both the admission authority and the appellant. It must take into account the parent’s reasons for wanting their child to attend the school in question, including what it can offer that other schools cannot.</p>

<p>If the panel considers that the appellant’s case outweighs the prejudice to the school, it must uphold the appeal.</p>

<p>When making decisions, the panel should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider each point raised by the parties and communicate to the clerk how they were weighed up</li>
  <li>ensure the final decisions and the reasonings are explicit</li>
  <li>reach a decision by a simple majority of votes cast, where the votes are equally divided the chair has the second or casting vote</li>
  <li>either uphold or dismiss an appeal without it being subject to any specified conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>During the decision making process, the clerk should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enable the panel to make its decision in private</li>
  <li>prompt the panel to consider all the issues raised by the parties and record the decision the panel has come to on each of the issues raised</li>
  <li>keep an accurate and comprehensive record of the decision making process, particularly the decisions reached by the panel on each of the issues raised by the parties</li>
</ul>

<p>After the hearing, the clerk should notify the parties of the panel’s decision within 5 school days where possible.</p>

<p>If there are likely to be delays, the clerk should inform the parties of this.</p>

<h2 id="appeals-for-admission-to-school-sixth-forms">Appeals for admission to school sixth forms</h2>

<p>Applicants and their parents may appeal a decision to refuse admission to a school sixth form.</p>

<p>When a parent’s and a child’s appeal are heard jointly, the panel must give both the parent and the child the opportunity to present their case. Each may present a different argument.</p>

<p>The panel must hear all the evidence on an issue before making a decision.</p>

<p>If the admission authority refused the application because more young people were eligible for a place than there were places available at the sixth form, then the panel should follow the two-stage process set out above.</p>

<p>However, if the admission authority refused an application because they did not meet the specified entry requirements, the panel must not make its own assessment of the applicant’s ability. It must only consider whether the admission authority’s decision was reasonable in light of the information available and that the child was not of the required standard.</p>

<h2 id="appeals-for-grammar-schools">Appeals for grammar schools</h2>

<p>If a child passes the entrance test, but the grammar school does not offer them a place because they offered all the places to those who more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the panel should follow the two-stage process set out above.</p>

<p>However, if a child did not pass the entrance exam, the panel must consider the appeal differently. First, the panel should establish whether a local review to reconsider whether the child is of grammar school ability has taken place. Where a local review has taken place, the panel must only consider whether they conducted it in a fair, consistent and objective way. It must not carry out the review process again.</p>

<p>However, where a local review did not take place, the panel may only uphold the appeal if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s satisfied that there is evidence to demonstrate that the child is of the required academic standards</li>
  <li>the parent’s case for appeal outweighs the admission authority’s case that admission of additional children would cause prejudice</li>
</ul>

<p>The panel must not devise its own methods to assess whether the child is of grammar school ability.</p>

<h2 id="appeals-for-boarding-schools">Appeals for boarding schools</h2>

<p>If a boarding school has refused a child admission because they offered all the places to those who more closely met the school’s admissions criteria, then the panel should follow the two-stage process set out above.</p>

<p>However, if the school refused a child admission because they deemed the child unsuitable to board, the panel must not make its own assessment of the child’s suitability. It must only consider whether the admission authority’s decision was reasonable in light of the information available to it.</p>

<h2 id="infant-class-size-appeals">Infant class size appeals</h2>

<p>Panels should hear infant class appeals in the same way as all other appeals. Clerks and panels should ensure that they treat both parties equally and give them both sufficient opportunity to present their case without unreasonable interruption.</p>

<p>Section 4 of the Appeals Code sets out the basis for upholding an infant class size appeal.</p>

<p>Panels must ensure they follow the 2 stage decision making process.</p>

<p>They must consider and decide on all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the admission of an additional child would breach the infant class size limit</li>
  <li>whether the school’s admission arrangements were unlawful</li>
  <li>whether the school’s admission arrangements were applied and correctly and impartially applied in the child’s case</li>
  <li>whether the decision to refuse admission was one which a reasonable admission authority would have made in the circumstances of the case</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply finding that the admission of an additional child breaches the infant class size limit and that the admission arrangements were lawful and applied correctly, does not mean the panel should automatically dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p>Panels must ensure they fully consider the parent’s case for appeal and examine whether the admission authority’s decision to refuse admission was reasonable.</p>

<p>Panels should consider relevant case law when making decisions on reasonableness.</p>

<h3 id="appeals-for-excepted-pupils">Appeals for ‘excepted pupils’</h3>

<p>The panel should not hold an appeal for a child who falls under one of the categories of excepted children (set out in paragraph 2.15 of the School Admissions Code) as an infant class size appeal.</p>

<p>The panel should treat an appeal as an infant class size appeal, if the reason for refusing admission is that admitting another child would breach the infant class size limit. Admitting a pupil who would fall within any category of excepted pupils would not breach the class size limit and therefore the panel should not treat it as an infant class size appeal.</p>

<h3 id="future-class-size-prejudice">Future class size prejudice</h3>

<p>In an infant class size appeal, panels should consider whether the admission of an additional child would beach the class size limit both in the year group in which the parent is seeking a place and all subsequent years of the infant phase. This ensures prejudice will not occur when the child moves up through the school.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-appeals">Multiple appeals</h2>

<p>If the admission authority receives multiple appeals for the same school, in the same year group, the panel must not make any decisions on any of those appeals until they have heard all the appeals.</p>

<p>The panel must ensure that the presenting officer does not produce new evidence in later appeals that they did not present in earlier appeals. As this would mean that appellants presenting cases in earlier appeals would not have the opportunity to consider and respond to the new evidence.</p>

<p>If new evidence comes out during the questioning of the presenting officer, the clerk must ensure that the panel considers what bearing that evidence has on all appeals.</p>

<h2 id="after-the-appeal-hearing">After the appeal hearing</h2>

<p>After the hearing, the clerk must notify the parties of the panel’s decision. The decision letter must contain a summary of relevant factors that each party raised and the panel’s considerations. It must also give clear reasons for the panel’s decision, including how the panel decided on any points raised by the both parties during the hearing.</p>

<p>The clerk or chair must sign the decision letter and send a copy to all parties within 5 school days, where possible. The clerk should inform all parties if they expect a delay in sending out the decision letter.</p>
