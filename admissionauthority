<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This advice is for school admission authorities.</p>

<p>It provides information about your responsibilities in relation to admission appeals hearings, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>setting up independent appeal panels</li>
  <li>ensuring that panel members and clerks are properly trained</li>
  <li>ensuring admission appeals are conducted in a fair, transparent and consistent manner</li>
</ul>

<p>It also provides advice on how you can present your case to the appeal panel and the type of evidence panels may wish to see.</p>

<p>You should read this advice in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">School Admission Appeals Code</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">School Admissions Code</a> and other laws that affect admissions and admission appeals in England.</p>

<h2 id="informing-parents-about-their-right-of-appeal">Informing parents about their right of appeal</h2>
<p>Parents refused a place at a school for which they have applied have the right to appeal to an independent appeal panel. This includes where a child is in the process of, or has already been allocated, an alternative school place via the local <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fair-access-protocols-in-school-admissions">Fair Access Protocol</a> or otherwise.</p>

<p>When you notify a parent of your decision to refuse a place at a school, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a reason why you refused admission</li>
  <li>inform them of their right to appeal to an independent appeal panel</li>
  <li>include information on how they can appeal</li>
</ul>

<p>This must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that appeals must be submitted in writing</li>
  <li>the deadline for submitting an appeal</li>
  <li>how they submit the appeal</li>
</ul>

<p>For infant class size appeals, you must also include the limited circumstances in which a panel can uphold an appeal.</p>

<h2 id="arrangements-for-organising-and-hearing-appeals">Arrangements for organising and hearing appeals</h2>

<p>You have the statutory responsibility for arranging appeals against the refusal of a place at your school.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>establish your own independent appeals panel</li>
  <li>make joint arrangements for hearing appeals with other admission authorities in the area</li>
  <li>use the appeals service provided by the local authority, there may be a charge for this</li>
  <li>contract the process out to a commercial organisation running appeals for schools, there will be a charge for this</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll remain responsible for ensuring that the appeals function for your school is carried out effectively and in accordance with statutory requirements.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-independent-appeal-panel">Setting up the independent appeal panel</h2>

<p>You must appoint a clerk to the appeal panel, who is independent of the school and the education functions of the local authority.</p>

<p>The clerk must have knowledge of both the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2">School Admissions Code</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code">the School Admissions Appeals Codes</a> and other laws relating to admissions, including equalities legislation.</p>

<p>You must also appoint an independent appeal panel, which must be comprised of a chair and at least two panel members, of which one is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lay person, someone without personal experience of managing a school or the provision of education in a school</li>
  <li>someone with experience in education and who is acquainted with the educational conditions in the local area, or who is the parent of a registered pupil in a school</li>
</ul>

<p>You must ensure that panel members are selected on the basis they can make fair and objective decisions. For schools with a religious designation, you must not select panel members solely because of their faith.</p>

<p>It’s important that panel members are independent and retain their independence at all times.</p>

<p>You must not appoint anybody as a panel member, whose involvement could raise doubts about impartiality.</p>

<p>This would include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employees of the local authority, school or trust</li>
  <li>a member or former member of the governing body</li>
  <li>a teacher or teaching assistant at the school</li>
  <li>a person involved in admission decisions at the school</li>
  <li>a person who has not had the relevant training to hear school admission appeals</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>You must ensure that clerks and panel members have the appropriate training before taking part in any part of the appeals process.</p>

<p>As a minimum, you must arrange and fund appropriate training on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the law relating to school admissions and admission appeals</li>
  <li>members’ duties under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Equalities Act 2010</li>
  <li>procedural fairness and natural justice</li>
  <li>the specific roles of particular members, such as clerking and chairing skills</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s your responsibility to ensure that appeal panels are set up correctly and with the appropriate training.</p>

<p>Failure to do so could result in further complaints, which may result in the need to rehear appeals.</p>

<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>

<p>In relation to centrally retained Dedicated Schools Grant funding, local authorities must treat all maintained schools and schools that are their own admission authority in their area equitably.</p>

<p>This means if local authorities use centrally held funding to provide a free admission appeals service for community and voluntary controlled schools, they must also provide this service free to academies, voluntary aided schools and foundation schools.</p>

<p>Alternatively, where local authorities delegate funding for appeals to all schools in their individual budgets, they may charge the budgets of their maintained schools for the costs associated with administering admissions appeals on their behalf.</p>

<p>Academies, voluntary aided schools and foundation schools may also wish to buy into the appeals services provided by the local authority or can make alternative arrangements.</p>

<h2 id="appeals-timetable">Appeals timetable</h2>

<p>By 28 February each year, you must set out on the school’s website a timetable for organising and hearing appeals.</p>

<p>This must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include a deadline for lodging appeals, which allows appellants at least 20 school days from the date of notification that their application was unsuccessful to prepare and submit their written appeal</li>
  <li>ensure that parents receive written notification of the date and arrangements of their hearing, at least 10 school days before their hearing</li>
  <li>include reasonable deadlines for appellants to submit additional evidence not submitted with the initial appeal, for admission authorities to submit their evidence, and for the clerk to send the appeal papers to the panel and parties</li>
  <li>ensure that the panel clerk sends out the decision letters with 5 school days of the hearing wherever possible</li>
</ul>

<p>You must ensure that the panel hears appeals submitted on time within the following timescales:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for applications made in the normal admissions round, appeals must be heard within 40 school days from the deadline for lodging appeals</li>
  <li>for late applications, appeals should be heard with 40 schools days from the deadline for lodging appeals, or within 30 school days of the appeal being submitted</li>
  <li>for in-year application appeals, the panel must hear appeals within 30 school days of them being submitted</li>
</ul>

<p>For applications to sixth form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the panel must hear appeals, where the offer of a place would have been conditional upon exam results, within 30 school days of confirmation of those results</li>
  <li>where the offer of a place would not have been conditional upon exam results, appeals must be heard within 40 school days of the deadline for lodging appeals</li>
</ul>

<p>If a parent submits an appeal after the appropriate deadline, you must still arrange for the panel to hear the appeal. Timescales for hearing such appeals should be set out in the published appeals timetable.</p>

<h2 id="the-appeal-hearing">The appeal hearing</h2>

<p>If you’re making your own arrangements for setting up and hearing appeals, you must ensure the following are in place for the hearing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an appropriate venue that is accessible to appellants</li>
  <li>suitable waiting areas for appellants and presenting officers to wait separately from the panel before and between appeals</li>
  <li>the panel holds the appeal hearings in private, and the hearing is conducted in the presence of all panel members and parties, parents and school presenting officers</li>
  <li>that the same panel hears multiple appeals for a school, as far as reasonably possible</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="your-role-during-the-appeals-process">Your role during the appeals process</h2>

<p>Once you’ve arranged to hear appeals for your school, your role is then to demonstrate to the panel why your school cannot admit any more children. And how doing so will have an adverse impact on the delivery of education or the education of the other children already admitted to the school.</p>

<h3 id="presenting-officer">Presenting officer</h3>

<p>You must provide a presenting officer to attend the hearing and present to the panel the reasons why the school cannot admit any more children. It is important that you select a member of staff who is well acquainted with the school to carry out this role.</p>

<p>It’s likely that the panel will ask detailed and challenging questions about the case being heard, the characteristics of the school such as school capacity, classroom sizes, the availability of staff and the school’s reasons for refusing admission.</p>

<h3 id="production-of-evidence">Production of evidence</h3>

<p>You must supply the panel with all it needs to conduct the hearing in a fair and transparent manner. This includes supplying the clerk with all the relevant documents needed to conduct the hearing, within the timescales set out, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the school’s admission arrangements</li>
  <li>how the admission arrangements and the coordinated admissions scheme were applied to the child in question</li>
  <li>the reasons for the decision to refuse admission</li>
  <li>an explanation as to how the admission of an additional child would cause prejudice to the provision of efficient education or efficient use of resources</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also comply with reasonable requests from parents for information, which they need to help them prepare for their appeal.</p>

<h3 id="demonstrating-prejudice">Demonstrating prejudice</h3>

<p>Unless you put forward a robust case to demonstrate that admitting an additional child to the school would prejudice the provision of efficient education or efficient use of resources, the panel must uphold the appeal.</p>

<p>This means you’ll have to demonstrate how admitting another child at the school will have a negative impact on the school’s resources. And how this will compromise the quality of education received by the existing pupils at the school.</p>

<p>Simply demonstrating that the school has reached its published admission number will not be sufficient. In both the school’s written statement and at the hearing, you must be able to demonstrate prejudice beyond the fact that the school has already reached its published admission number.</p>

<p>Where you’ve refused a child a school place, despite places being available, for example where a child has challenging behaviour, you must present the school’s case for refusing admission. You must demonstrate how prejudice will occur despite the school not reaching its published admission number.</p>

<p>Failing to demonstrate prejudice effectively will result in the admission authority losing the appeal and having to admit an additional pupil, or pupils, if the panel decides that the school can accommodate them.</p>

<h3 id="factors-considered-by-the-panel">Factors considered by the panel</h3>

<p>In making their decisions as to whether or not prejudice will occur should an additional child be admitted to the school, the panel will consider the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the effect an additional child would have on the school in the current and following academic years as the year group moves through the school</li>
  <li>whether any changes have been made to the school’s physical accommodation or organisation since the admission number was originally set for the relevant year group</li>
  <li>the impact on the organisation and size of classes, the availability of teaching staff, and the effect on children already at the school</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, you should focus on presenting evidence to demonstrate these factors.</p>

<p>This could include presenting evidence to demonstrate the following.</p>

<p>Any pressures on staffing and their workloads, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>numbers of teaching and non-teaching staff and the impact additional children will have on their ability to deliver effective education</li>
  <li>the number of children with high needs registered on roll and the impact this will have on both teaching and non-teaching staff, as well as the existing pupils at the school</li>
</ul>

<p>Any restrictions in the school’s facilities, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>classroom sizes and the number of children they can accommodate</li>
  <li>size of shared spaces such as dining areas, assembly areas, sporting facilities, examination areas and the number of children they can accommodate</li>
  <li>any pressures on physical space which may result in health and safety concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>Any evidence must be specific to the school and the impact it’ll have on the school in delivering effective education. For example, the comparison of school data with national averages will not be sufficient in demonstrating prejudice will occur should an additional child be admitted to the school.</p>

<p>You should also avoid making speculative statements of future prejudice. For example, speculation about possible budget cuts or the reduction of staffing levels will not be sufficient in demonstrating prejudice.</p>

<h2 id="infant-class-size-appeals">Infant class size appeals</h2>

<p>For an infant class size appeal, you should focus on demonstrating how the admission of an additional child would breach the infant class size limit and that the decision to refuse admission was reasonable.</p>

<p>This can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>information around the limited number of teaching staff at the school, and why further teaching staff cannot be deployed to accommodate additional infant aged pupils</li>
  <li>
    <p>information on the number of infant classes at the school - note that the physical size of classrooms are less relevant in an infant class size appeal, as the legislation limits the size of such classes to 30 pupils per school teacher, despite the physical size of the classroom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the organisation of classes in all other subsequent years of the infant phase - panels take into account whether the admission of an additional child would breach the infant class size limit, not only in the year in which the parent is seeking a place, but also in all other subsequent years of the infant phase</p>
  </li>
  <li>demonstrating that the circumstances of the case was given sufficient consideration, before the decision to refuse admission was made</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes-and-records-of-proceedings">Notes and records of proceedings</h2>

<p>It’s your responsibility to keep notes and records of appeals proceedings securely for a minimum of two years.</p>

<h2 id="further-appeals">Further appeals</h2>

<p>If an appellant is unsuccessful in their appeal, they do not have the right to a second appeal for the same school place.</p>

<p>However, if you’ve accepted a second application from them due an exceptional change in their circumstances, and you refuse this again, you must give parents the opportunity to appeal again.</p>

<h2 id="further-complaints">Further complaints</h2>

<p>You must inform parents about the arrangements for making further complaints if their appeal is unsuccessful.</p>

<p>You should provide information about where parents can direct their complaints and the types of complaints that can be  investigated, in relation to complaints of maladministration.</p>

<p>For complaints about an appeal for a maintained school, you should direct parents to the <a rel="external" href="https://www.lgo.org.uk">Local Government Ombudsman</a>.</p>

<p>For complaints about an appeal for an academy, you should direct parents to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions/appealing-a-schools-decision">Education Skills and Funding Agency</a>.</p>
