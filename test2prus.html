	<p>If you have more than one criteria for offering places, for example, if you are a catholic grammar, only enter one intake code.</p>

	<h3 id="unique-pupil-number-upn">Unique pupil number (UPN)</h3>
	
	<p>The UPN is a 13-character code that identifies each pupil in local-authority-maintained schools.</p>
	
	<p>You should not calculate it manually as the UPN would either be:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>generated by management information system (MIS)</li>
	<li>transferred to you from another school in a common transfer file (CTF)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>‘AnnnnnnnnnnnA’ is a temporary UPN that you should only use as an interim measure. For further information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unique-pupil-numbers">UPN policy and practice guidance</a>.</p>

	
	<h3 id="pupils-former-upn">Pupil’s former UPN</h3>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is adopted, a new unique pupil number (UPN) is issued with no link or reference made to their former UPN. You should not add the previous UPN for an adopted pupil in this field.</p>
	
	<p>Where a (non-adopted) pupil has held another UPN whilst at your school (such as a temporary UPN was allocated, but replaced by a permanent one), you should add the temporary UPN.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-characteristics">Pupil characteristics</h3>
	
	<p>You should include in full for each pupil their:</p>

	<li>surname</li>

	<li>middle names (leave blank if the pupil doesn’t have a middle name)</li>
	<li>preferred surname (if applicable)</li>
	<li>former surname (if applicable)</li>
	<li>gender</li>
	<li>date of birth</li>
	<li>country of UK</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="language-code-used-for-funding">Language code [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We require data on ethnicity for all pupils. This information must come from the parent / guardian or pupil.</p>
	
	<p>You should only use codes ENB (not known but believed to be English) and OTB (not known but believed to be other than English) where all of the following conditions apply:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>pupil’s first language is not known with absolute certainty</li>
	<li>parents have not responded to enquiries</li>
	<li>school is able to judge with a high degree of confidence whether the pupil’s language is English or not</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a parent / guardian or pupil declines to provide a first language, you should record it as ‘REF’ (refused).</p>
	
	<h3 id="free-school-meal-eligibility-used-for-funding">Free school meal eligibility [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Pupils who were eligible for free school meals on 31 March 2018 or after, should continue to receive free school meals until their phase of education ends.</p>
	
	<p>This applies even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria. You should enter free school meal eligibility data in each census.</p>

	<p>Where schools have free school meals eligibility flagged for a pupil in their systems they must ensure their systems include a free school meals start date ready for collection in census and transfer in common transfer files.</p>
	
	<p>You can return multiple free school meals eligibility start and end dates falling within the periods above where applicable.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil had been eligible for free school meals from 1 September until 31 October in a school in Wales and moved to a school in England and claimed eligibility from the 1 November.</p>
	
	<p>For the first period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-09-01 and ‘FSM’ eligibility end date of 2018-10-31 UK country code must be recorded as ‘WLS’</li>

	<p>For the second period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-11-01 and no ‘FSM’ eligibility end date, UK country code must be blank or recorded as ‘ENG’</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p>Schools should record periods of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools-and-local-authorities">free school meals eligibility</a> for pupils where a claim has been made by them or on their behalf and either:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the relevant local authority/school has confirmed that they are entitled to free school meals</li>
	<li>the relevant local authority/school has seen the necessary documentation (that confirms entitlement to free school meals</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Any claimant who is in receipt of free school meals on or after 31 March 2018 should continue to receive free school meals until the end of the universal credit roll out period, and then until their phase of education ends. This applies until summer 2023 even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	
	<p>It is not necessary for schools / local authorities to calculate a family‘s annual taxable income. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) perform this income calculation and this figure is used to determine free school meal entitlement.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Free school meals eligibility checking service</strong></p>
	
	<p>The free school meals (FSM) eligibility checking service streamlines the FSM eligibility checking process for both local authorities and parents.</p>
	
	<p>Academies are not able to access the service directly. Some academies ask their local authority (often for a fee) to check eligibility via the eligibility checking service on their behalf. The service available, and its cost, varies between local authorities.</p>

	<p>There is a legal requirement under the Education and Skills Act 2008 for schools to pass information on request to the youth support service for pupils in or approaching the age of 13.</p>
	
	<h3 id="service-children-in-education-indicator-used-for-funding">Service children in education indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We collect data to indicate all service child in education pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>You must only record this information if it has come from the parent / guardian and / or child.</p>
	
	<p>This field defaults to ‘N’ so you only need to change it for entries for children from service families.</p>
	
	<p>It is essential that you record this data item be correctly on the school census as we use this to determine the pupil premium allocations for schools.</p>
	
	<p>A ‘service child’ has parent(s) - or person(s) with parental responsibility - who is / are service personnel serving:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>in regular HM Forces military units</li>
	<li>in full commitment as part of the full-time reserve service</li>
	<li>in the armed forces of another nation and stationed in England</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Reserve units are not classed as the regular armed forces and such pupils are not recorded as service children on the school census. However, where a reserve soldier is acting in a full-time capacity, this is classified as regular service.</p>
	
	<p>The service children indicator is only relevant to children whose parents are designated as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-status-category-definitions">personal category 1 or 2</a>. All parents will be aware of their personal category.</p>
	
	<h3 id="funded-free-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding">Funded free entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours record, for eligible pupils aged two, three and four years, the total number of free entitlement to early education funded hours in education provision (following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school. This information is provided by all schools with relevant age children: with the exception of city technology colleges and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	
	<p>All children become eligible for free early education from the term following a child’s third birthday irrespective of background or family circumstances (the universal free entitlement). A specified subset of disadvantaged two year olds also become eligible from the term following a child’s second birthday. Local authorities will confirm which children meet the eligibility criteria should schools not know. Some three and four-year-olds are also eligible for up to an additional 15 hours per week – the extended free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>The table below shows the dates of birth and year groups of children for whom funded free entitlement hours are required. Where a child falls into the cohorts listed below but is not in receipt of any funding via the free entitlements, a value of zero is recorded for funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>Data collected via the spring census is used by the department to determine the early years block of the dedicated schools grant allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>Although not used centrally by the department for funding allocations, funded free entitlement hours from the autumn and summer census may be used locally by local authorities for funding early education.</p>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours contain only the hours the pupil is in education provision and following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage. Such education will follow the department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and excludes any hours where the pupils are not receiving education or any additional hours that are funded by other means (such as the parent).</p>
	
	<p>From the 2019 to 2020 financial year, all children will be capped at 15 hours for the universal entitlement as we set out in our government response to the early years national funding formula in December 2016. This is a change and will be reflected in local authority funding from 2019 to 2020.</p>

	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year in ‘reception’ and above are funded as full-time equivalent pupils via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant and therefore funded free entitlement hours are not relevant or required for those pupils, as they are not funded via the free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the funded free entitlement hours spent in education at each school. The main registration records funded hours in education at the main registration, with the subsidiary recording funded hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>It is important that the funded free entitlement hours recorded on the census accurately reflect the hours at the setting to two decimal places. It should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes. For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 20 minutes, this is recorded as 10.33 and so on</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="extended-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding">Extended entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Extended entitlement hours are collected for 3 and 4 year old children, with working parents, who are in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school.</p>
	
	<p>As with the universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours become available – where the parent has a valid 30-hour code - from the term following a child’s third birthday until they reach compulsory school age. Extended entitlement hours are available for pupils aged three and those pupils aged four who are in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ or ‘N2’ only.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who are in ‘reception’ (or above) are not eligible for extended entitlement hours, as they are in full-time education.</p>
	
	<p>As with universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours are recorded to two decimal places and it should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes.
	For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 40 minutes, this is recorded as 10.67 of extended entitlement hours per week (up to a maximum of 15 hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a child is in receipt of extended entitlement hours, the maximum funded free entitlement hours allowable is 15 hours. The extended entitlement hours field must not include any universal funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<h3 id="hour-indicator">30 hour indicator</h3>
	
	<p>The 30 hour code indicator is an 11-digit integer that is required for pupils who claim extended entitlement hours. As with the extended entitlement hours field, this applies to all 3 year olds and those pupils aged 4 in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only. The code confirms the eligibility of working parents to receive the 15 extended entitlement hours funding. This is particularly important as parents may split this entitlement between 2 providers.</p>
	
	<p>The code, once issued, remains fixed and refers to a single parent / child combination -where a parent has two children, each child will have their own code. However, when the school is presented with the code by the parent, the school must confirm the code’s validity with their local authority.</p>
	
	<p>Where a child transfers school, the local authority must be informed of the transfer.</p>
	
	<p>From September 2018, foster children are eligible for 30 hours free childcare in certain circumstances. Foster parents will not apply for the extended free entitlement through the Childcare Service due to the additional eligibility checking steps required. The 30-hour code indicator will be issued by the local authority to the foster parents. Providers will still check the code in the same way as for any other parent taking up 30 hours. It should be noted that although it will still be an 11-digit code, it will begin with a different number to HMRC issued codes. This is to allow local management of the reconfirmation process. Further information about 30 hours free childcare is available in the Department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and the Department’s early years entitlements operational guidance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="disability-access-fund-indicator-used-for-funding">Disability access fund indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The disability access fund (DAF) indicator records, for eligible pupils aged three and four, the receipt of DAF funding. Three and four-year-olds will be eligible for the DAF if they meet the following criteria:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the child is in receipt of child disability living allowance</li>
	<li>the child receives free early education (via the universal entitlement or extended childcare hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 as at the 31 August in reception and above, who are funded via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant, are not eligible for DAF funding. Further information on the DAF is available in the early years national funding formula (EYNFF) operational guidance.</p>
	
	<p>The DAF indicator should only be returned for eligible children within the date of birth range, and year groups, outlined below.</p>

	<h3 id="hours-at-setting-used-for-funding">Hours at setting [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Hours at setting are collected for the same pupils and schools for whom funded free entitlement hours are collected. This data item records for pupils aged 2, 3 and 4 years old, the total number of hours they spent in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school irrespective of who funded the hours – it is the total of:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any hours funded under the free early education entitlements</li>
	<li>plus any hours funded under extended entitlement (for working parents)</li>
	<li>plus any additional hours of education funded from other sources such as parents</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This information will allow the department to monitor the hours attended at maintained settings on the same basis as private/voluntary/independent provision.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the actual hours attending each school. The main registration records the hours in education at the main registration. The subsidiary registration records the hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>Hours at setting records the hours in education to two decimal places (that is, where a pupil has 10 and a-half-hours, for example, this is recorded as 10.50, with 10 and three-quarter hours being 10.75).</p>
	
	<h3 id="top-up-funding-indicator-used-for-funding">Top-up funding indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We are using the top-up funding indicator in the new high needs national funding formula that has been introduced to calculate high needs funding allocation from 2018 to 2019. In addition, we use this indicator for research purposes and to provide benchmarking information to local areas. As such, it is very important that all schools complete this correctly and follow the guidance provided.</p>
	
	<p>This is a true / false flag to indicate those pupils on roll for whom the school receives, on census day, top-up funding - either from a local authority or, in the case of a PRU / AP, a local authority or another school.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid outside a maintained school’s budget share or academy’s general annual grant and relates to a pupil or student identified as requiring additional support, which costs more than a specified threshold. In many cases, the period for which top-up funding is paid may not be defined but the top-up funding will - as with the SEN provision to which it relates - be subject to periodic review.</p>
	
	<p>Usually, but not always, the pupils for whom a primary or secondary mainstream school receives top-up funding are those with an education, health and care (EHC) plan. Sometimes local authorities may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - SEN support. Locally this top-up funding may be called by a different name: in cases of doubt, schools should check with their local authority to make sure that this is recorded correctly for each individual pupil.</p>
	
	<p>The specified cost threshold for additional SEN support varies according to the type of provision. For primary and secondary mainstream schools and academies, the threshold is £6,000 per pupil per annum in all cases.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid in respect of individual pupils whose additional support costs more than this, and is for the excess costs over the threshold. However, in the case of all special schools, special academies, special free schools, PRU / AP, the funding they receive is £10,000 per place, and the top-up funding will be for the costs incurred by the school in providing additional support in excess of this funding. Because the full cost of places in special schools, special academies and special free schools, PRU / AP usually exceeds £10,000, these types of schools will normally receive top-up funding for most, if not all, of the pupils in the school.</p>
	
	<h3 id="post-looked-after-arrangements-used-for-funding">Post looked after arrangements [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Post looked after arrangements collects information regarding children, who – on census day – have left local authority care in England and Wales through adoption, a special guardianship order, a residence order or a child arrangements order. Children who have left care under one of the measures listed above will be eligible for the post looked after element of the pupil premium.</p>
	
	<p>It is for those with parental responsibility (adoptive parents, special guardians and carers of former looked after children on residence / child arrangements orders) to decide if they wish to self-declare their children’s status to schools. Schools should ensure parents and carers are aware of this and that this information is collected to help ensure that the designated teacher for previously looked after children can support those children and the school can attract pupil premium funding to support this cohort. Parents are to provide supporting evidence, for example, a photocopy of the adoption order, and confirm that their child was previously in care in England or Wales.</p>
	
	<p>Parents may conceal sensitive information (for example the name of the birth parents) should they wish.</p>
	
	<p>Schools are reminded that this is particularly sensitive data and of the ongoing need for confidentiality. Schools should ensure that, as for other pupil level data items, they comply with their responsibilities with respect to GDPR when processing this data.</p>
	
	<p>Schools record the information using the following codeset. Only one of the values will apply to each pupil and a school’s MIS should provide a default value of N – not declared.</p>

	<li>English / maths GCSE funding exemption - used to determine if a student is exempt from the condition of funding or has an equivalent UK qualification</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>There are only 2 exemptions to the condition of funding:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the student’s learning difficulty prevents them studying a GCSE or stepping stone qualification that meets the condition of funding: code ‘L’</li>
	<li>the student’s overseas qualification is equivalent to GCSE ‘9’ to ‘4’, ‘A*’ to ‘C’ code ‘O’</li>

	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="part-time-indicator">Part-time indicator</h3>
	
	<p>We consider a pupil full-time where they are in education for 10 sessions per week. A pupil who attends for 9 (or fewer) sessions is part-time.</p>
	
	<p>There is no link between funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours and sessions.</p>
	
	<p>For 30 hours of childcare (funded hours and extended hours), you can include a lunch break.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>A child may attend a 2 and a half hour morning and afternoon session, with an hour for lunch: 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the morning, 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the afternoon plus 5 hours for lunch = 30 hours.</p>

	<p>The year group in which the pupil is taught for the majority of their time, irrespective of their chronological age.</p>
	
	<p>Children turning 2 years old fall into the ‘E2’ year group. If they are recorded on the school’s admission register, you need to include them in your census return.</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect any younger children who fall into the ‘E1’ year group to be in receipt of education and should not be on the school’s admissions register. If you need to record children in ‘E1’ within your MIS, you should record with an enrolment status of ‘guest’ and not include them in your census.</p>

	<h3 id="exclusion-start-date">Exclusion start date</h3>
	
	<p>The exclusion start date reflects the date that the head teacher asked the pupil to leave the school. By not collecting the data until 2 terms after that in which the exclusion started, we expect you to have completed all appeals procedures by the time of the return, so only exclusions that have been upheld will be included.</p>
	
	<h3 id="actual-number-of-sessions-excluded-from">Actual number of sessions excluded from</h3>
	
	<p>For each fixed period and lunchtime exclusion, you should record the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect.</p>
	
	<p>For fixed period exclusions, each full school day counts as 2 sessions - a half school day counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>Where a fixed period exclusion is for a lunchtime, each lunchtime for which the exclusion applies counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>You should count exclusions that go across 2 census collection periods as 1 exclusion in the first collection period.</p>
	
	<p>Exclusion sessions only cover the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school. A fixed period exclusion can be discontinuous which means that there can be days between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for the day(s) they attending the other organisation.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil is excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Monday. However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday – where no exclusion is in place. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The other provider would record the pupil’s attendance on the Wednesday separately.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>For the sessions where the school have agreed that the pupil is not attending, you should record these as ‘authorised absence’ and not record the pupil as excluded for these sessions.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded for 8 sessions starting on a Tuesday. However, the pupil already has authorised absence for Friday and Monday afternoons. This means the pupil is excluded for all sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, as well as the morning sessions on Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>You should not record exclusions sessions for the day(s) when the pupil is attending an approved educational activity.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which they are not excluded. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Wednesday, Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Days on which there is a planned school closure do not count towards an exclusion.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for 4 sessions starting on a Friday, but the school plans to be closed on the Monday for an INSET day. This means the pupil’s exclusion will include 2 sessions on the following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="sen-provision">SEN provision</h3>
	
	<p>The Children and Families Act 2014 replaced Statements of Educational Need (SEN statements) with ‘Education, Health and Care plans’ (EHC plans).</p>
	
	<p>You should record any remaining SEN statements as EHC plans for the purpose of this data collection.</p>
	
	<p>We need data for all pupils on roll on the census day. SEN provision at the time of any exclusion will also be collected in all school census collections.</p>
	
	<h2 id="home-information">Home information</h2>
	
	<p>We only collect this information if the ‘pupil address type’ is ‘C’ (current).</p>
	
	<p>Schools can provide the department with their addresses in the format their MIS holds the data:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>BS7666 address format</li>
	<li>SAON, PAON, post town or other address item</li>
	<li>address line 1 to 5</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Every format requires a postcode.</p>
	
	<p>We expect schools to provide a valid home address for most of their pupils (including boarding pupils).</p>
	
	<p>You should record boarding pupils from abroad using their ‘home’ address as their residence during term time, which may be the school’s address.</p>
	
	<p>If a child has multiple addresses (where the child lives with both parents at different stages of the week) you should supply both addresses.</p>
	
	<p>If it is possible to get the address, you should leave these fields blank or add a partial address and ignore the validation errors.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unique-property-reference-number">Unique property reference number</h3>
	
	<p>A unique property reference number (UPRN) is a unique integer identifier for every address in Great Britain.</p>
	
	<p>The UPRN is a voluntary data item which you may choose to return alongside the full address (in either BS7666 or address line structure).</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect schools to collect, or look up, the UPRN and instead this will be automatically populated within your school system when entering addresses if the OS AddressBase database is used as a reference.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-possible">Sessions possible</h3>
	
	<p>This records the number of sessions possible for the attendance period (term or half term). There are 2 sessions for each school day (morning and afternoon).</p>
	
	<p>Every pupil aged 4 to 15 (excluding boarders) at the previous 31 August who was on the school roll for at least one session during the specified attendance period (term or half term) should have an entry for the number of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<p>Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, manually calculate and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-authorised-absence">Sessions missed due to authorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Authorised absence is an absence that has been authorised by a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes where a parent has provided a satisfactory explanation, for example, illness.</p>
	
	<p>Schools can retrospectively authorise an absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-unauthorised-absence">Sessions missed due to unauthorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Unauthorised absence is an absence without permission from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences; for example, arriving late for school after the register has closed.</p>
	
	<p>It does not apply to pupils of non-compulsory school age (those aged 4 years).</p>
	
	<h4 id="pupil-absence-and-attendance-codes">Pupil absence and attendance codes</h4>
	
	<p>This relates to authorised or unauthorised absences for the pupil. Schools will be aware of the full range of absence and attendance codes, which include values for attendance and for approved education activities, as these codes are used by schools MIS when recording pupil attendance.</p>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, schools are not obliged to use individual absence and attendance codes. If schools do not wish to use these codes, then they should just provide the total number of absences for the attendance period by recording these as sessions missed due to authorised absence. Absences recorded for 4-year-olds will not be treated as ‘authorised’ or ‘unauthorised’ and instead will be reported, and published, as overall absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="number-of-sessions-missed">Number of sessions missed</h3>
	
	<p>The number of sessions missed for each specified reason for absence. Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, will manually calculate the number of session missed and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h4 id="summer-half-term">Summer half term</h4>
	
	<p>Study leave should be used sparingly and only granted to year 11 pupils during public examinations. As study leave is unsupervised, schools must record it as an authorised absence. Study leave is no longer applicable once examinations are concluded.</p>
	
	<p>The official school leaving date is the last Friday in June of the school year in which a child reaches age 16. This means that year 11 pupils must remain on the school roll until Friday 28 June 2019 and you must record their attendance to this date.</p>
	
	<p>Where pupils were born on or after 1999-09-01, they must remain in some form of education or training until their 18th birthday.</p>
	
	<p>Attendance data for the second half of the summer term in respect of pupils aged 15 years old is not published in any national statistics.</p>

	<h3 id="unique-pupil-number-upn-1">Unique pupil number (UPN)</h3>
	
	<p>The UPN is a 13-character code that identifies each pupil in local-authority-maintained schools.</p>
	
	<p>You should not calculate it manually as the UPN would either be:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>generated by management information system (MIS)</li>
	<li>transferred to you from another school in a common transfer file (CTF)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>‘AnnnnnnnnnnnA’ is a temporary UPN that you should only use as an interim measure. For further information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unique-pupil-numbers">UPN policy and practice guidance</a>.</p>

	
	<h3 id="pupils-former-upn-1">Pupil’s former UPN</h3>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is adopted, a new unique pupil number (UPN) is issued with no link or reference made to their former UPN. You should not add the previous UPN for an adopted pupil in this field.</p>
	
	<p>Where a (non-adopted) pupil has held another UPN whilst at your school (such as a temporary UPN was allocated, but replaced by a permanent one), you should add the temporary UPN.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-characteristics-1">Pupil characteristics</h3>
	
	<p>You should include in full for each pupil their:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>surname</li>
	<li>forename</li>
	<li>middle names (leave blank if the pupil doesn’t have a middle name)</li>
	<li>preferred surname (if applicable)</li>
	<li>former surname (if applicable)</li>
	<li>gender</li>
	<li>date of birth</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="language-code-used-for-funding-1">Language code [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We require data on ethnicity for all pupils. This information must come from the parent / guardian or pupil.</p>
	
	<p>You should only use codes ENB (not known but believed to be English) and OTB (not known but believed to be other than English) where all of the following conditions apply:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>pupil’s first language is not known with absolute certainty</li>
	<li>parents have not responded to enquiries</li>
	<li>school is able to judge with a high degree of confidence whether the pupil’s language is English or not</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a parent / guardian or pupil declines to provide a first language, you should record it as ‘REF’ (refused).</p>
	
	<h4 id="planned-employability-enrichment-and-pastoral-hours-used-for-funding-1">Planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours [used for funding]</h4>
	
	<p>In this field, we need data on the total planned employability, enrichment and pastoral hours for the student for the current academic year. The value you record is the number of hours as planned at the start of the programme.</p>
	
	<p>If the number of planned hours changes later in the year, you do not need to update the census.</p>

	<h3 id="gcse-maths-and-english-condition-of-funding-used-for-funding-1">GCSE maths and English condition of funding [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Students aged 16 to 18 and 19 to 25 with an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan who do not hold a GCSE grade ‘9’ to ‘4’, ‘A*’ to ‘C’ or equivalent, must study maths and / or English as part of their programme. Maths and English study is a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-maths-and-english-condition-of-funding">condition of funding</a>. We will remove funding for students who do not meet the condition.</p>
	
	<p>We need 2 data items in the census to record when students meet the condition of funding:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>English / maths GCSE highest prior attainment – used to determine if a student needs to take an approved English or maths GCSE or stepping stone qualification</li>
	<li>English / maths GCSE funding exemption - used to determine if a student is exempt from the condition of funding or has an equivalent UK qualification</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>There are only 2 exemptions to the condition of funding:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the student’s learning difficulty prevents them studying a GCSE or stepping stone qualification that meets the condition of funding: code ‘L’</li>
	<li>the student’s overseas qualification is equivalent to GCSE ‘9’ to ‘4’, ‘A*’ to ‘C’ code ‘O’</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You should record students who hold an equivalent UK qualification using code ‘U’.</p>
	
	<h3 id="english-and-maths-gcse-prior-attainment-year-group-used-for-funding-1">English and maths GCSE prior attainment year group [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The census records whether a student has achieved English and / or maths GCSEs at grades ‘9’ to ‘4’, ‘A*’ to ‘C’ by the end of year 11. We use this to determine whether a student is eligible for block 2 disadvantage funding.</p>
	
	<p>More information on disadvantage block 2 funding is in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a>.</p>
	
	<h3 id="date-of-entry-used-for-funding-1">Date of entry [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-date-of-leaving">Pupil date of leaving</h3>
	
	<p>You should add pupil date of entry, date of leaving and part-time indicator for any pupils who are no longer on roll, but are included in your attendance and exclusion data.</p>
	
	<h3 id="part-time-indicator-and-funded-free-entitlement--extended-free-entitlement-hours">Part-time indicator and funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours</h3>

	<p>For each fixed period and lunchtime exclusion, you should record the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect.</p>
	
	<p>For fixed period exclusions, each full school day counts as 2 sessions - a half school day counts as 1 session.</p>

	<p>You should count exclusions that go across 2 census collection periods as 1 exclusion in the first collection period.</p>
	
	<p>Exclusion sessions only cover the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school. A fixed period exclusion can be discontinuous which means that there can be days between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>

	<p>This records the number of sessions possible for the attendance period (term or half term). There are 2 sessions for each school day (morning and afternoon).</p>
	
	<p>Every pupil aged 4 to 15 (excluding boarders) at the previous 31 August who was on the school roll for at least one session during the specified attendance period (term or half term) should have an entry for the number of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<p>Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, manually calculate and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-authorised-absence-1">Sessions missed due to authorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Authorised absence is an absence that has been authorised by a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes where a parent has provided a satisfactory explanation, for example, illness.</p>
	
	<p>Schools can retrospectively authorise an absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-unauthorised-absence-1">Sessions missed due to unauthorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Unauthorised absence is an absence without permission from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences; for example, arriving late for school after the register has closed.</p>
	
	<p>It does not apply to pupils of non-compulsory school age (those aged 4 years).</p>
	
	<h4 id="pupil-absence-and-attendance-codes-1">Pupil absence and attendance codes</h4>
	
	<p>This relates to authorised or unauthorised absences for the pupil. Schools will be aware of the full range of absence and attendance codes, which include values for attendance and for approved education activities, as these codes are used by schools MIS when recording pupil attendance.</p>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, schools are not obliged to use individual absence and attendance codes. If schools do not wish to use these codes, then they should just provide the total number of absences for the attendance period by recording these as sessions missed due to authorised absence. Absences recorded for 4-year-olds will not be treated as ‘authorised’ or ‘unauthorised’ and instead will be reported, and published, as overall absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="number-of-sessions-missed-1">Number of sessions missed</h3>
	
	<p>The number of sessions missed for each specified reason for absence. Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, will manually calculate the number of session missed and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h4 id="summer-half-term-1">Summer half term</h4>
	
	<p>Study leave should be used sparingly and only granted to year 11 pupils during public examinations. As study leave is unsupervised, schools must record it as an authorised absence. Study leave is no longer applicable once examinations are concluded.</p>
	
	<p>The official school leaving date is the last Friday in June of the school year in which a child reaches age 16. This means that year 11 pupils must remain on the school roll until Friday 28 June 2019 and you must record their attendance to this date.</p>
	
	<p>Where pupils were born on or after 1999-09-01, they must remain in some form of education or training until their 18th birthday.</p>
	
	<p>Attendance data for the second half of the summer term in respect of pupils aged 15 years old is not published in any national statistics.</p>

	<p>Where schools have free school meals eligibility flagged for a pupil in their systems they must ensure their systems include a free school meals start date ready for collection in census and transfer in common transfer files.</p>
	
	<p>You can return multiple free school meals eligibility start and end dates falling within the periods above where applicable.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil had been eligible for free school meals from 1 September until 31 October in a school in Wales and moved to a school in England and claimed eligibility from the 1 November.</p>
	
	<p>For the first period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-09-01 and ‘FSM’ eligibility end date of 2018-10-31 UK country code must be recorded as ‘WLS’</li>

	</ul>
	
	<p>Any claimant who is in receipt of free school meals on or after 31 March 2018 should continue to receive free school meals until the end of the universal credit roll out period, and then until their phase of education ends. This applies until summer 2023 even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	
	<p>It is not necessary for schools / local authorities to calculate a family‘s annual taxable income. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) perform this income calculation and this figure is used to determine free school meal entitlement.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Free school meals eligibility checking service</strong></p>
	
	<p>The free school meals (FSM) eligibility checking service streamlines the FSM eligibility checking process for both local authorities and parents.</p>
	
	<p>Academies are not able to access the service directly. Some academies ask their local authority (often for a fee) to check eligibility via the eligibility checking service on their behalf. The service available, and its cost, varies between local authorities.</p>

	<p>There is a legal requirement under the Education and Skills Act 2008 for schools to pass information on request to the youth support service for pupils in or approaching the age of 13.</p>
	
	<h3 id="service-children-in-education-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Service children in education indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We collect data to indicate all service child in education pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>You must only record this information if it has come from the parent / guardian and / or child.</p>
	
	<p>This field defaults to ‘N’ so you only need to change it for entries for children from service families.</p>
	
	<p>It is essential that you record this data item be correctly on the school census as we use this to determine the pupil premium allocations for schools.</p>
	
	<p>A ‘service child’ has parent(s) - or person(s) with parental responsibility - who is / are service personnel serving:</p>

	<li>in the armed forces of another nation and stationed in England</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Reserve units are not classed as the regular armed forces and such pupils are not recorded as service children on the school census. However, where a reserve soldier is acting in a full-time capacity, this is classified as regular service.</p>
	
	<p>The service children indicator is only relevant to children whose parents are designated as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-status-category-definitions">personal category 1 or 2</a>. All parents will be aware of their personal category.</p>
	
	<h3 id="funded-free-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding-1">Funded free entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours record, for eligible pupils aged two, three and four years, the total number of free entitlement to early education funded hours in education provision (following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school. This information is provided by all schools with relevant age children: with the exception of city technology colleges and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	
	<p>All children become eligible for free early education from the term following a child’s third birthday irrespective of background or family circumstances (the universal free entitlement). A specified subset of disadvantaged two year olds also become eligible from the term following a child’s second birthday. Local authorities will confirm which children meet the eligibility criteria should schools not know. Some three and four-year-olds are also eligible for up to an additional 15 hours per week – the extended free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>The table below shows the dates of birth and year groups of children for whom funded free entitlement hours are required. Where a child falls into the cohorts listed below but is not in receipt of any funding via the free entitlements, a value of zero is recorded for funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>Data collected via the spring census is used by the department to determine the early years block of the dedicated schools grant allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>Although not used centrally by the department for funding allocations, funded free entitlement hours from the autumn and summer census may be used locally by local authorities for funding early education.</p>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours contain only the hours the pupil is in education provision and following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage. Such education will follow the department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and excludes any hours where the pupils are not receiving education or any additional hours that are funded by other means (such as the parent).</p>
	
	<p>From the 2019 to 2020 financial year, all children will be capped at 15 hours for the universal entitlement as we set out in our government response to the early years national funding formula in December 2016. This is a change and will be reflected in local authority funding from 2019 to 2020.</p>

	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year in ‘reception’ and above are funded as full-time equivalent pupils via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant and therefore funded free entitlement hours are not relevant or required for those pupils, as they are not funded via the free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the funded free entitlement hours spent in education at each school. The main registration records funded hours in education at the main registration, with the subsidiary recording funded hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>It is important that the funded free entitlement hours recorded on the census accurately reflect the hours at the setting to two decimal places. It should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes. For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 20 minutes, this is recorded as 10.33 and so on</li>

	<p>As with the universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours become available – where the parent has a valid 30-hour code - from the term following a child’s third birthday until they reach compulsory school age. Extended entitlement hours are available for pupils aged three and those pupils aged four who are in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ or ‘N2’ only.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who are in ‘reception’ (or above) are not eligible for extended entitlement hours, as they are in full-time education.</p>
	
	<p>As with universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours are recorded to two decimal places and it should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes.
	For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 40 minutes, this is recorded as 10.67 of extended entitlement hours per week (up to a maximum of 15 hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a child is in receipt of extended entitlement hours, the maximum funded free entitlement hours allowable is 15 hours. The extended entitlement hours field must not include any universal funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<h3 id="hour-indicator-1">30 hour indicator</h3>
	
	<p>The 30 hour code indicator is an 11-digit integer that is required for pupils who claim extended entitlement hours. As with the extended entitlement hours field, this applies to all 3 year olds and those pupils aged 4 in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only. The code confirms the eligibility of working parents to receive the 15 extended entitlement hours funding. This is particularly important as parents may split this entitlement between 2 providers.</p>
	
	<p>The code, once issued, remains fixed and refers to a single parent / child combination -where a parent has two children, each child will have their own code. However, when the school is presented with the code by the parent, the school must confirm the code’s validity with their local authority.</p>
	
	<p>Where a child transfers school, the local authority must be informed of the transfer.</p>
	
	<p>From September 2018, foster children are eligible for 30 hours free childcare in certain circumstances. Foster parents will not apply for the extended free entitlement through the Childcare Service due to the additional eligibility checking steps required. The 30-hour code indicator will be issued by the local authority to the foster parents. Providers will still check the code in the same way as for any other parent taking up 30 hours. It should be noted that although it will still be an 11-digit code, it will begin with a different number to HMRC issued codes. This is to allow local management of the reconfirmation process. Further information about 30 hours free childcare is available in the Department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and the Department’s early years entitlements operational guidance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="disability-access-fund-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Disability access fund indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The disability access fund (DAF) indicator records, for eligible pupils aged three and four, the receipt of DAF funding. Three and four-year-olds will be eligible for the DAF if they meet the following criteria:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the child is in receipt of child disability living allowance</li>
	<li>the child receives free early education (via the universal entitlement or extended childcare hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 as at the 31 August in reception and above, who are funded via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant, are not eligible for DAF funding. Further information on the DAF is available in the early years national funding formula (EYNFF) operational guidance.</p>
	
	<p>The DAF indicator should only be returned for eligible children within the date of birth range, and year groups, outlined below.</p>

	<p>Hours at setting are collected for the same pupils and schools for whom funded free entitlement hours are collected. This data item records for pupils aged 2, 3 and 4 years old, the total number of hours they spent in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school irrespective of who funded the hours – it is the total of:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any hours funded under the free early education entitlements</li>
	<li>plus any hours funded under extended entitlement (for working parents)</li>
	<li>plus any additional hours of education funded from other sources such as parents</li>

	<h3 id="early-years-pupil-premium-used-for-funding">Early years pupil premium [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The early years pupil premium (EYPP) is additional funding for early years settings to improve the education they provide for disadvantaged 3 and 4 year olds (all 3 and 4 year olds are entitled to up to 15 hours per week of government funded free entitlement early education for 38 weeks of the year).</p>
	
	<p>Provided that they are taking the universal 15 hours free entitlement and meet the eligibility criteria, children become eligible to receive early years pupil premium from the term following a child’s third birthday and retain this entitlement until they move into ‘reception’, when they become eligible to receive the ‘mainstream’ pupil premium.</p>
	
	<p>Only children in receipt of EYPP in census week should be recorded with early years pupil premium receipt equal to ‘true’.</p>
	
	<p>EYPP is paid by local authorities direct to settings. Its award is dependent on the application by parents of eligible children to their local authority, which will use the eligibility checking service to verify their application against benefits related data.</p>
	
	<p>Children are eligible to receive EYPP if they receive the universal 15 hours entitlement and either:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>meet benefits related criteria equivalent to those for free school meals (please note: meals provided as part of the universal entitlement are not FSM; receipt of FSM does not automatically qualify a child for EYPP)</li>
	<li>are in the care of the local authority (in England or Wales)</li>
	<li>have left care (in England or Wales) through:
	<ul>
	<li>adoption</li>
	<li>special guardianship</li>
	<li>a child arrangements order (formerly known as a residence order)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This data, collected via the spring census, will be used by the department to determine the early years pupil premium allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>In the spring census, we need early years pupil premium data for:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>all 3 year olds - irrespective of school type and year group</li>
	<li>4 year olds at nursery schools (phase equals ‘NS’) – all year groups</li>
	<li>4 year olds at all schools other than nurseries (phase does not equal ‘NS’) – pupil national curriculum year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year, in reception are eligible to receive the school age pupil premium so are not eligible to receive early years pupil premium funding.</p>
	
	<h3 id="learner-support-code-bursary-funding-for-16-to-19-year-olds-used-for-funding">Learner support code (bursary funding for 16 to 19 year olds) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The learner support code indicates the type of financial support awarded to pupils beyond compulsory school leaving age at any point in the academic year of the school census.</p>
	
	<p>There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursary fund support:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups (code ‘55’)</li>
	<li>discretionary bursaries which institutions award to meet individual needs, for example, help with the cost of transport, meals, books and equipment (code ‘56’)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The learner support code is collected for all pupils who have been awarded bursary funding in the current academic year. This may include pupils who have left the school since the start of the academic year. For dual registered pupils, the school holding the main registration for the pupil is responsible for awarding the bursary fund and return the required data.</p>
	
	<p>The 16 to 19 bursary fund is administered locally by providers and local authorities who receive their funding allocation directly from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). Whilst schools may be able to record in their systems other types of financial support awarded to these pupils, the school census only collects codes 55 and 56.</p>
	
	<p>During the academic year the circumstances of a student awarded the discretionary element may change and they could become part of a designated vulnerable group. In such circumstances the individual would also qualify for the award of the vulnerable payment (on a pro-rata basis for the academic year). For example, a student may be awarded the discretionary element in September 2018 and then the vulnerable group bursary in February 2019. In such a situation, code 56 would be returned in the spring school census and both code ‘56’ and code ‘55’ in the summer school census.</p>
	
	<p>Information about whether a student is actually in receipt of funding is not required for the school census. The purpose of the collection is to establish how many students been awarded bursary funding in the academic year.</p>
	
	<p>Each new academic year requires a new application for funding by students.</p>
	
	<h3 id="top-up-funding-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Top-up funding indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We are using the top-up funding indicator in the new high needs national funding formula that has been introduced to calculate high needs funding allocation from 2018 to 2019. In addition, we use this indicator for research purposes and to provide benchmarking information to local areas. As such, it is very important that all schools complete this correctly and follow the guidance provided.</p>
	
	<p>This is a true / false flag to indicate those pupils on roll for whom the school receives, on census day, top-up funding - either from a local authority or, in the case of a PRU / AP, a local authority or another school.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid outside a maintained school’s budget share or academy’s general annual grant and relates to a pupil or student identified as requiring additional support, which costs more than a specified threshold. In many cases, the period for which top-up funding is paid may not be defined but the top-up funding will - as with the SEN provision to which it relates - be subject to periodic review.</p>
	
	<p>Usually, but not always, the pupils for whom a primary or secondary mainstream school receives top-up funding are those with an education, health and care (EHC) plan. Sometimes local authorities may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - SEN support. Locally this top-up funding may be called by a different name: in cases of doubt, schools should check with their local authority to make sure that this is recorded correctly for each individual pupil.</p>
	
	<p>The specified cost threshold for additional SEN support varies according to the type of provision. For primary and secondary mainstream schools and academies, the threshold is £6,000 per pupil per annum in all cases.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid in respect of individual pupils whose additional support costs more than this, and is for the excess costs over the threshold. However, in the case of all special schools, special academies, special free schools, PRU / AP, the funding they receive is £10,000 per place, and the top-up funding will be for the costs incurred by the school in providing additional support in excess of this funding. Because the full cost of places in special schools, special academies and special free schools, PRU / AP usually exceeds £10,000, these types of schools will normally receive top-up funding for most, if not all, of the pupils in the school.</p>
	
	<h3 id="post-looked-after-arrangements-used-for-funding-1">Post looked after arrangements [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Post looked after arrangements collects information regarding children, who – on census day – have left local authority care in England and Wales through adoption, a special guardianship order, a residence order or a child arrangements order. Children who have left care under one of the measures listed above will be eligible for the post looked after element of the pupil premium.</p>
	
	<p>It is for those with parental responsibility (adoptive parents, special guardians and carers of former looked after children on residence / child arrangements orders) to decide if they wish to self-declare their children’s status to schools. Schools should ensure parents and carers are aware of this and that this information is collected to help ensure that the designated teacher for previously looked after children can support those children and the school can attract pupil premium funding to support this cohort. Parents are to provide supporting evidence, for example, a photocopy of the adoption order, and confirm that their child was previously in care in England or Wales.</p>
	
	<p>Parents may conceal sensitive information (for example the name of the birth parents) should they wish.</p>
	
	<p>Schools are reminded that this is particularly sensitive data and of the ongoing need for confidentiality. Schools should ensure that, as for other pupil level data items, they comply with their responsibilities with respect to GDPR when processing this data.</p>
	
	<p>Schools record the information using the following codeset. Only one of the values will apply to each pupil and a school’s MIS should provide a default value of N – not declared.</p>

	<p>The pupil enrolment status - recorded within the schools management information system (MIS) using one of the registration codes. It is important that each pupil recorded within the school census be assigned a correct enrolment status. This ensures the pupil is correctly registered at a school in line with the pupil registration regulations.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils recorded as ‘guest’ should not be included in the census return.</p>

	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>

	<p>There is no link between funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours and sessions.</p>
	
	<p>For 30 hours of childcare (funded hours and extended hours), you can include a lunch break.</p>

	<p>A child may attend a 2 and a half hour morning and afternoon session, with an hour for lunch: 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the morning, 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the afternoon plus 5 hours for lunch = 30 hours.</p>

	<p>We do not expect any younger children who fall into the ‘E1’ year group to be in receipt of education and should not be on the school’s admissions register. If you need to record children in ‘E1’ within your MIS, you should record with an enrolment status of ‘guest’ and not include them in your census.</p>

	<h3 id="pupil-sen-type-ranking">Pupil SEN type ranking</h3>
	
	<p>This indicates the ranking of a pupil’s special educational need, as recorded in pupil SEN type. The most significant, or primary need, is ranked as ‘1’ with any secondary need ranked ‘2’.

	<h3 id="exclusion-start-date-2">Exclusion start date</h3>
	
	<p>The exclusion start date reflects the date that the head teacher asked the pupil to leave the school. By not collecting the data until 2 terms after that in which the exclusion started, we expect you to have completed all appeals procedures by the time of the return, so only exclusions that have been upheld will be included.</p>
	
	<h3 id="actual-number-of-sessions-excluded-from-2">Actual number of sessions excluded from</h3>
	
	<p>For each fixed period and lunchtime exclusion, you should record the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect.</p>
	
	<p>For fixed period exclusions, each full school day counts as 2 sessions - a half school day counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>Where a fixed period exclusion is for a lunchtime, each lunchtime for which the exclusion applies counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>You should count exclusions that go across 2 census collection periods as 1 exclusion in the first collection period.</p>
	
	<p>Exclusion sessions only cover the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school. A fixed period exclusion can be discontinuous which means that there can be days between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for the day(s) they attending the other organisation.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil is excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Monday. However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday – where no exclusion is in place. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The other provider would record the pupil’s attendance on the Wednesday separately.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>For the sessions where the school have agreed that the pupil is not attending, you should record these as ‘authorised absence’ and not record the pupil as excluded for these sessions.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded for 8 sessions starting on a Tuesday. However, the pupil already has authorised absence for Friday and Monday afternoons. This means the pupil is excluded for all sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, as well as the morning sessions on Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>You should not record exclusions sessions for the day(s) when the pupil is attending an approved educational activity.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which they are not excluded. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Wednesday, Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Days on which there is a planned school closure do not count towards an exclusion.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for 4 sessions starting on a Friday, but the school plans to be closed on the Monday for an INSET day. This means the pupil’s exclusion will include 2 sessions on the following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.</p>

	<h3 id="exclusion-reinstatement-date">Exclusion reinstatement date</h3>
	<p>The exclusion reinstatement date reflects the date the school readmitted the pupil following the exclusion review.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sen-expert-requested">SEN expert requested</h3>
	<p>Schools must record if a SEN expert was requested during the review as ‘Y’ if requested and ‘N’ if not requested.</p>
	
	<h2 id="home-information-1">Home information</h2>
	
	<p>We only collect this information if the ‘pupil address type’ is ‘C’ (current).</p>
	
	<p>Schools can provide the department with their addresses in the format their MIS holds the data:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>BS7666 address format</li>
	<li>SAON, PAON, post town or other address item</li>
	<li>address line 1 to 5</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Every format requires a postcode.</p>
	
	<p>We expect schools to provide a valid home address for most of their pupils (including boarding pupils).</p>
	
	<p>You should record boarding pupils from abroad using their ‘home’ address as their residence during term time, which may be the school’s address.</p>
	
	<p>If a child has multiple addresses (where the child lives with both parents at different stages of the week) you should supply both addresses.</p>
	
	<p>If it is possible to get the address, you should leave these fields blank or add a partial address and ignore the validation errors.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unique-property-reference-number-1">Unique property reference number</h3>
	
	<p>A unique property reference number (UPRN) is a unique integer identifier for every address in Great Britain.</p>
	
	<p>The UPRN is a voluntary data item which you may choose to return alongside the full address (in either BS7666 or address line structure).</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect schools to collect, or look up, the UPRN and instead this will be automatically populated within your school system when entering addresses if the OS AddressBase database is used as a reference.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-possible-2">Sessions possible</h3>
	
	<p>This records the number of sessions possible for the attendance period (term or half term). There are 2 sessions for each school day (morning and afternoon).</p>
	
	<p>Every pupil aged 4 to 15 (excluding boarders) at the previous 31 August who was on the school roll for at least one session during the specified attendance period (term or half term) should have an entry for the number of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<p>Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, manually calculate and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-authorised-absence-2">Sessions missed due to authorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Authorised absence is an absence that has been authorised by a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes where a parent has provided a satisfactory explanation, for example, illness.</p>
	
	<p>Schools can retrospectively authorise an absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-unauthorised-absence-2">Sessions missed due to unauthorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Unauthorised absence is an absence without permission from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences; for example, arriving late for school after the register has closed.</p>
	
	<p>It does not apply to pupils of non-compulsory school age (those aged 4 years).</p>
	
	<h4 id="pupil-absence-and-attendance-codes-2">Pupil absence and attendance codes</h4>
	
	<p>This relates to authorised or unauthorised absences for the pupil. Schools will be aware of the full range of absence and attendance codes, which include values for attendance and for approved education activities, as these codes are used by schools MIS when recording pupil attendance.</p>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, schools are not obliged to use individual absence and attendance codes. If schools do not wish to use these codes, then they should just provide the total number of absences for the attendance period by recording these as sessions missed due to authorised absence. Absences recorded for 4-year-olds will not be treated as ‘authorised’ or ‘unauthorised’ and instead will be reported, and published, as overall absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="number-of-sessions-missed-2">Number of sessions missed</h3>
	
	<p>The number of sessions missed for each specified reason for absence. Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, will manually calculate the number of session missed and add to their census return.</p>

	<h3 id="unique-pupil-number-upn-3">Unique pupil number (UPN)</h3>
	
	<p>The UPN is a 13-character code that identifies each pupil in local-authority-maintained schools.</p>
	
	<p>You should not calculate it manually as the UPN would either be:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>generated by management information system (MIS)</li>
	<li>transferred to you from another school in a common transfer file (CTF)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>‘AnnnnnnnnnnnA’ is a temporary UPN that you should only use as an interim measure. For further information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unique-pupil-numbers">UPN policy and practice guidance</a>.</p>

	
	<h3 id="pupils-former-upn-3">Pupil’s former UPN</h3>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is adopted, a new unique pupil number (UPN) is issued with no link or reference made to their former UPN. You should not add the previous UPN for an adopted pupil in this field.</p>
	
	<p>Where a (non-adopted) pupil has held another UPN whilst at your school (such as a temporary UPN was allocated, but replaced by a permanent one), you should add the temporary UPN.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-characteristics-3">Pupil characteristics</h3>
	
	<p>You should include in full for each pupil their:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>surname</li>
	<li>forename</li>
	<li>middle names (leave blank if the pupil doesn’t have a middle name)</li>
	<li>preferred surname (if applicable)</li>
	<li>former surname (if applicable)</li>
	<li>gender</li>
	<li>date of birth</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="ethnicity-1">Ethnicity</h3>
	
	<p>We require data on ethnicity for all pupils. This information must come from the parent / guardian or pupil.</p>
	
	<p>If you have not collected this data, you should record it as ‘NOBT’ (information not yet obtained).</p>
	
	<p>Where a parent / guardian or pupil declines to provide ethnicity data, you should record it as ‘REFU’ (refused).</p>
	
	<h3 id="language-code-used-for-funding-3">Language code [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We require data on ethnicity for all pupils. This information must come from the parent / guardian or pupil.</p>
	
	<p>You should only use codes ENB (not known but believed to be English) and OTB (not known but believed to be other than English) where all of the following conditions apply:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>pupil’s first language is not known with absolute certainty</li>
	<li>parents have not responded to enquiries</li>
	<li>school is able to judge with a high degree of confidence whether the pupil’s language is English or not</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a parent / guardian or pupil declines to provide a first language, you should record it as ‘REF’ (refused).</p>
	
	<h3 id="learner-support-code-bursary-funding-for-16-to-19-year-olds-used-for-funding-1">Learner support code (bursary funding for 16 to 19 year olds) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The learner support code indicates the type of financial support awarded to pupils beyond compulsory school leaving age at any point in the academic year of the school census.</p>
	
	<p>There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursary fund support:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups (code ‘55’)</li>
	<li>discretionary bursaries which institutions award to meet individual needs, for example, help with the cost of transport, meals, books and equipment (code ‘56’)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The learner support code is collected for all pupils who have been awarded bursary funding in the current academic year. This may include pupils who have left the school since the start of the academic year. For dual registered pupils, the school holding the main registration for the pupil is responsible for awarding the bursary fund and return the required data.</p>
	
	<p>The 16 to 19 bursary fund is administered locally by providers and local authorities who receive their funding allocation directly from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). Whilst schools may be able to record in their systems other types of financial support awarded to these pupils, the school census only collects codes 55 and 56.</p>
	
	<p>During the academic year the circumstances of a student awarded the discretionary element may change and they could become part of a designated vulnerable group. In such circumstances the individual would also qualify for the award of the vulnerable payment (on a pro-rata basis for the academic year). For example, a student may be awarded the discretionary element in September 2019 and then the vulnerable group bursary in February 2020. In such a situation, code 56 would be returned in the spring school census and both code ‘56’ and code ‘55’ in the summer school census.</p>
	
	<p>Information about whether a student is actually in receipt of funding is not required for the school census. The purpose of the collection is to establish how many students been awarded bursary funding in the academic year.</p>
	
	<p>Each new academic year requires a new application for funding by students.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-date-of-entry-used-for-funding">Pupil date of entry [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-date-of-leaving-1">Pupil date of leaving</h3>
	<p>We need pupil status data for all pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>You should add pupil date of entry, date of leaving and part-time indicator for any pupils who are no longer on roll, but are included in your attendance and exclusion data.</p>
	
	<h3 id="part-time-indicator-1">Part-time indicator</h3>
	
	<p>We consider a pupil full-time where they are in education for 10 sessions per week. A pupil who attends for 9 (or fewer) sessions is part-time.</p>
	
	<p>There is no link between funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours and sessions.</p>
	
	<p>For 30 hours of childcare (funded hours and extended hours), you can include a lunch break.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>A child may attend a 2 and a half hour morning and afternoon session, with an hour for lunch: 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the morning, 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the afternoon plus 5 hours for lunch = 30 hours.</p>
	
	<p>The child is full-time, based on the number of sessions (10) having attended morning and afternoon session each day for 5 days.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-boarder-indicator-used-for-funding">Pupil boarder indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Indicates whether a pupil is a boarder. The MIS automatically defaults the value of this field to ‘N’ - not a boarder.</p>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-category-3">Exclusion category</h3>
	
	<p>For each exclusion, this indicates the type of exclusion:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>fixed period</li>
	<li>permanent</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-reason-3">Exclusion reason</h3>
	
	<p>Some MIS allow schools to enter more than one reason for any exclusion and so they can record a main as well as a secondary reason(s) for any exclusion. For the census, we only need the main reason.</p>

	<h3 id="exclusion-start-date-3">Exclusion start date</h3>
	
	<p>The exclusion start date reflects the date that the head teacher asked the pupil to leave the school. 
	We expect you to have completed all appeals procedures by the time of the return, so only exclusions that have been upheld will be included.</p>
	
	<h3 id="actual-number-of-sessions-excluded-from-3">Actual number of sessions excluded from</h3>
	
	<p>For each fixed period exclusion, you should record the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect.</p>
	
	<p>For fixed period exclusions, each full school day counts as 2 sessions - a half school day counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>Where a fixed period exclusion is for a lunchtime, each lunchtime for which the exclusion applies counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>You should count exclusions that go across 2 census collection periods as 1 exclusion in the first collection period.</p>
	
	<p>Exclusion sessions only cover the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school. A fixed period exclusion can be discontinuous which means that there can be days between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for the day(s) they attending the other organisation.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil is excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Monday. However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday – where no exclusion is in place. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The other provider would record the pupil’s attendance on the Wednesday separately.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>For the sessions where the school have agreed that the pupil is not attending, you should record these as ‘authorised absence’ and not record the pupil as excluded for these sessions.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded for 8 sessions starting on a Tuesday. However, the pupil already has authorised absence for Friday and Monday afternoons. This means the pupil is excluded for all sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, as well as the morning sessions on Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>You should not record exclusions sessions for the day(s) when the pupil is attending an approved educational activity.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which they are not excluded. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Wednesday, Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Days on which there is a planned school closure do not count towards an exclusion.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for 4 sessions starting on a Friday, but the school plans to be closed on the Monday for an INSET day. This means the pupil’s exclusion will include 2 sessions on the following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="sen-provision-at-the-time-of-the-exclusion-2">SEN provision at the time of the exclusion</h3>

	<li>‘K’ (SEN support)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-review-1">Exclusion review</h3>
	<p>You should not return information about independent review panels or initial governor reviews for fixed period exclusions.
	We will collect this data in the spring 2020 census for any reviews that took place in the autumn term.
	The exclusion review date reflects the date of the exclusion review (the date that the final outcome was decided).</p>

	<p>Where schools have free school meals eligibility flagged for a pupil in their systems they must ensure their systems include a free school meals start date ready for collection in census and transfer in common transfer files.</p>
	
	<p>You can return multiple free school meals eligibility start and end dates falling within the periods above where applicable.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil had been eligible for free school meals from 1 September until 31 October in a school in Wales and moved to a school in England and claimed eligibility from the 1 November.</p>
	
	<p>For the first period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2019-09-01 and ‘FSM’ eligibility end date of 2019-10-31 UK country code must be recorded as ‘WLS’</li>

	<p><strong>Eligibility for free school meals</strong></p>
	
	<p>Schools should record periods of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools-and-local-authorities">free school meals eligibility</a> for pupils where a claim has been made by them or on their behalf and either:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the relevant local authority / school has confirmed that they are entitled to free school meals</li>
	<li>the relevant local authority / school has seen the necessary documentation (that confirms entitlement to free school meals</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Any claimant who is in receipt of free school meals on or after 31 March 2018 should continue to receive free school meals until the end of the universal credit roll out period, and then until their phase of education ends. This applies until summer 2023 even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	
	<p>It is not necessary for schools / local authorities to calculate a family‘s annual taxable income. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) perform this income calculation and this figure is used to determine free school meal entitlement.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Free school meals eligibility checking service</strong></p>
	
	<p>The free school meals (FSM) eligibility checking service streamlines the FSM eligibility checking process for both local authorities and parents.</p>
	
	<p>Academies are not able to access the service directly. Some academies ask their local authority (often for a fee) to check eligibility via the eligibility checking service on their behalf. The service available, and its cost, varies between local authorities.</p>
	
	<h3 id="school-lunches-taken-used-for-funding-2">School lunches taken [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This data item records whether an infant pupil has taken a school lunch on census day. This may include packed lunches provided by the school to children on school trips.</p>
	
	<p>We collect this data each term from all schools and use it to allocate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-infant-free-school-meals-guide-for-schools-and-local-authorities">universal infant free school meal funding</a>.</p>

	<p>You should return this data item for all pupils who are aged 12 and above (as at 2019-08-31). If it is not completed the system will default to ‘unsought’.</p>
	
	<p>There is a legal requirement under the Education and Skills Act 2008 for schools to pass information on request to the youth support service for pupils in or approaching the age of 13.</p>
	
	<h3 id="service-children-in-education-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Service children in education indicator [used for funding]</h3>

	<p>You must only record this information if it has come from the parent / guardian and / or child.</p>
	
	<p>This field defaults to ‘N’ so you only need to change it for entries for children from service families.</p>
	
	<p>It is essential that you record this data item be correctly on the school census as we use this to determine the pupil premium allocations for schools.</p>
	
	<p>A ‘service child’ has parent(s) - or person(s) with parental responsibility - who is / are service personnel serving:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>in regular HM Forces military units</li>
	<li>in full commitment as part of the full-time reserve service</li>
	<li>in the armed forces of another nation and stationed in England</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Reserve units are not classed as the regular armed forces and such pupils are not recorded as service children on the school census. However, where a reserve soldier is acting in a full-time capacity, this is classified as regular service.</p>
	
	<p>The service children indicator is only relevant to children whose parents are designated as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-status-category-definitions">personal category 1 or 2</a>. All parents will be aware of their personal category.</p>
	
	<h3 id="funded-universal-free-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding">Funded universal free entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Funded universal free entitlement hours record, for eligible pupils aged 2, 3 and 4 years, the total number of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-education-and-childcare--2">free entitlement to early education</a> funded hours in education provision (following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school. This information is provided by all schools with relevant age children: with the exception of city technology colleges and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	
	<p>All children become eligible for free early education from the term following a child’s third birthday irrespective of background or family circumstances (the universal free entitlement). A specified subset of disadvantaged 2 year olds also become eligible from the term following a child’s second birthday. Local authorities will confirm which children meet the eligibility criteria should schools not know. Some 3 and 4-year-olds are also eligible for up to an additional 15 hours per week – the extended free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>The table below shows the dates of birth and year groups of children for whom funded free entitlement hours are required. Where a child falls into the cohorts listed below but is not in receipt of any funding via the free entitlements, a value of zero is recorded for funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>Data collected via the spring census is used by the department to determine the early years block of the dedicated schools grant allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>Although not used centrally by the department for funding allocations, funded universal free entitlement hours from the autumn and summer census may be used locally by local authorities for funding early education.</p>
	
	<p>Funded universal free entitlement hours contain only the hours the pupil is in education provision and following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage. Such education will follow the department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and excludes any hours where the pupils are not receiving education or any additional hours that are funded by other means (such as the parent).</p>

	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year in ‘reception’ and above are funded as full-time equivalent pupils via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant and therefore funded universal free entitlement hours are not relevant or required for those pupils, as they are not funded via the free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the funded universal free entitlement hours spent in education at each school. The main registration records funded hours in education at the main registration, with the subsidiary recording funded hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>It is important that the funded universal free entitlement hours recorded on the census accurately reflect the hours at the setting to two decimal places. It should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes. For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 20 minutes, this is recorded as 10.33 and so on</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="extended-free-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding">Extended free entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Extended free entitlement hours are collected for 3 and 4 year old children, with working parents, who are in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school.</p>
	
	<p>As with the funded universal free entitlement hours, extended free entitlement hours become available – where the parent has a valid 30-hour code - from the term following a child’s third birthday until they reach compulsory school age. Extended entitlement hours are available for pupils aged three and those pupils aged four who are in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ or ‘N2’ only.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who are in ‘reception’ (or above) are not eligible for extended free entitlement hours, as they are in full-time education.</p>
	
	<p>As with funded universal free entitlement hours, extended free entitlement hours are recorded to 2 decimal places and it should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes.
	For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 40 minutes, this is recorded as 10.67 of extended entitlement hours per week (up to a maximum of 15 hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a child is in receipt of extended free entitlement hours, the maximum funded free entitlement hours allowable is 15 hours. The extended free entitlement hours field must not include any funded universal free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<h3 id="hour-code-indicator">30-hour code indicator</h3>
	<p>The 30-hour code indicator is an 11-digit integer that is required for pupils who claim extended entitlement hours. As with the extended entitlement hours field, this applies to all 3 year olds and those pupils aged 4 in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only. The code confirms the eligibility of working parents to receive the 15 extended entitlement hours funding. This is particularly important as parents may split this entitlement between 2 providers.</p>
	
	<p>The code, once issued, remains fixed and refers to a single parent / child combination -where a parent has two children, each child will have their own code. However, when the school is presented with the code by the parent, the school must confirm the code’s validity with their local authority.</p>
	
	<p>Where a child transfers school, the local authority must be informed of the transfer.</p>
	
	<p>Foster children are eligible for 30 hours free childcare in certain circumstances. Foster parents will not apply for the extended free entitlement through the Childcare Service due to the additional eligibility checking steps required. The 30-hour code indicator will be issued by the local authority to the foster parents. Providers will still check the code in the same way as for any other parent taking up 30 hours. It should be noted that although it will still be an 11-digit code, it will begin with a different number to HMRC issued codes. This is to allow local management of the reconfirmation process. Further information about 30 hours free childcare is available in the Department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and the Department’s early years entitlements operational guidance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="disability-access-fund-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Disability access fund indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The disability access fund (DAF) indicator records, for eligible pupils aged three and four, the receipt of DAF funding. Three and four-year-olds will be eligible for the DAF if they meet the following criteria:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the child is in receipt of child disability living allowance</li>
	<li>the child receives free early education (via the universal entitlement or extended childcare hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 as at the 31 August in reception and above, who are funded via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant, are not eligible for DAF funding. Further information on the DAF is available in the early years national funding formula (EYNFF) operational guidance.</p>
	
	<p>The DAF indicator should only be returned for eligible children within the date of birth range, and year groups, outlined below.</p>

	<h3 id="hours-at-setting-used-for-funding-2">Hours at setting [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Hours at setting are collected for the same pupils and schools for whom funded universal free entitlement hours are collected. This data item records for pupils aged 2, 3 and 4 years old, the total number of hours they spent in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school irrespective of who funded the hours – it is the total of:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any hours funded under the free early education entitlements</li>
	<li>plus any hours funded under extended free entitlement (for working parents)</li>
	<li>plus any additional hours of education funded from other sources such as parents</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This information will allow the department to monitor the hours attended at maintained settings on the same basis as private / voluntary / independent provision.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the actual hours attending each school. The main registration records the hours in education at the main registration. The subsidiary registration records the hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>Hours at setting records the hours in education to two decimal places (that is, where a pupil has 10 and a-half-hours, for example, this is recorded as 10.50, with 10 and three-quarter hours being 10.75).</p>
	
	<h3 id="learner-support-code-bursary-funding-for-16-to-19-year-olds-used-for-funding-2">Learner support code (bursary funding for 16 to 19 year olds) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The learner support code indicates the type of financial support awarded to pupils beyond compulsory school leaving age at any point in the academic year of the school census.</p>
	
	<p>There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursary fund support:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups (code ‘55’)</li>
	<li>discretionary bursaries which institutions award to meet individual needs, for example, help with the cost of transport, meals, books and equipment (code ‘56’)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The learner support code is collected for all pupils who have been awarded bursary funding in the current academic year. This may include pupils who have left the school since the start of the academic year. For dual registered pupils, the school holding the main registration for the pupil is responsible for awarding the bursary fund and return the required data.</p>
	
	<p>The 16 to 19 bursary fund is administered locally by providers and local authorities who receive their funding allocation directly from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). Whilst schools may be able to record in their systems other types of financial support awarded to these pupils, the school census only collects codes 55 and 56.</p>
	
	<p>During the academic year the circumstances of a student awarded the discretionary element may change and they could become part of a designated vulnerable group. In such circumstances the individual would also qualify for the award of the vulnerable payment (on a pro-rata basis for the academic year). For example, a student may be awarded the discretionary element in September 2019 and then the vulnerable group bursary in February 2020. In such a situation, code 56 would be returned in the spring school census and both code ‘56’ and code ‘55’ in the summer school census.</p>
	
	<p>Information about whether a student is actually in receipt of funding is not required for the school census. The purpose of the collection is to establish how many students been awarded bursary funding in the academic year.</p>
	
	<p>Each new academic year requires a new application for funding by students.</p>
	
	<h3 id="top-up-funding-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Top-up funding indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We are using the top-up funding indicator in the new high needs national funding formula that has been introduced to calculate high needs funding allocation from 2019 to 2020. In addition, we use this indicator for research purposes and to provide benchmarking information to local areas. As such, it is very important that all schools complete this correctly and follow the guidance provided.</p>
	
	<p>This is a true / false flag to indicate those pupils on roll for whom the school receives, on census day, high-needs top-up funding - either from a local authority or, in the case of a PRU / AP, a local authority or another school.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid outside a maintained school’s budget share or academy’s general annual grant and relates to a pupil or student identified as requiring additional support, which costs more than a specified threshold. In many cases, the period for which top-up funding is paid may not be defined but the top-up funding will - as with the SEN provision to which it relates - be subject to periodic review.</p>
	
	<p>Usually, but not always, the pupils for whom a primary or secondary mainstream school receives top-up funding are those with an education, health and care (EHC) plan. Sometimes local authorities may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - SEN support. Locally this top-up funding may be called by a different name: in cases of doubt, schools should check with their local authority to make sure that this is recorded correctly for each individual pupil.</p>
	
	<p>The specified cost threshold for additional SEN support varies according to the type of provision. For primary and secondary mainstream schools and academies, the threshold is £6,000 per pupil per annum in all cases.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid in respect of individual pupils whose additional support costs more than this, and is for the excess costs over the threshold. However, in the case of all special schools, special academies, special free schools, PRU / AP, the funding they receive is £10,000 per place, and the top-up funding will be for the costs incurred by the school in providing additional support in excess of this funding. Because the full cost of places in special schools, special academies and special free schools, PRU / AP usually exceeds £10,000, these types of schools will normally receive top-up funding for most, if not all, of the pupils in the school.</p>
	
	<h3 id="post-looked-after-arrangements-used-for-funding-2">Post looked after arrangements [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Post looked after arrangements collects information regarding children, who – on census day – have left local authority care in England and Wales through adoption, a special guardianship order, a residence order or a child arrangements order. Children who have left care under one of the measures listed above will be eligible for the post looked after element of the pupil premium.</p>
	
	<p>It is for those with parental responsibility (adoptive parents, special guardians and carers of former looked after children on residence / child arrangements orders) to decide if they wish to self-declare their children’s status to schools. Schools should ensure parents and carers are aware of this and that this information is collected to help ensure that the designated teacher for previously looked after children can support those children and the school can attract pupil premium funding to support this cohort. Parents are to provide supporting evidence, for example, a photocopy of the adoption order, and confirm that their child was previously in care in England or Wales.</p>
	
	<p>Parents may conceal sensitive information (for example the name of the birth parents) should they wish.</p>
	
	<p>Schools are reminded that this is particularly sensitive data and of the ongoing need for confidentiality. Schools should ensure that, as for other pupil level data items, they comply with their responsibilities with respect to GDPR when processing this data.</p>
	
	<p>Schools record the information using the following codeset. Only one of the values will apply to each pupil and a school’s MIS should provide a default value of N – not declared.</p>

	<h3 id="pupil-enrolment-status-used-for-funding">Pupil enrolment status [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The pupil enrolment status - recorded within the schools management information system (MIS) using one of the registration codes. It is important that each pupil recorded within the school census be assigned a correct enrolment status. This ensures the pupil is correctly registered at a school in line with the pupil registration regulations.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils recorded as ‘guest’ should not be included in the census return.</p>
	
	<p>The MIS will automatically default the value of this field to ‘C’ - current (single registration at this school).</p>
	
	<h3 id="learner-support-code-bursary-funding-for-16-to-19-year-olds-used-for-funding-3">Learner support code (bursary funding for 16 to 19 year olds) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The learner support code indicates the type of financial support awarded to pupils beyond compulsory school leaving age at any point in the academic year of the school census.</p>
	
	<p>There are 2 types of 16 to 19 bursary fund support:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a vulnerable bursary of up to £1,200 a year for young people in one of the defined vulnerable groups (code ‘55’)</li>
	<li>discretionary bursaries which institutions award to meet individual needs, for example, help with the cost of transport, meals, books and equipment (code ‘56’)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The learner support code is collected for all pupils who have been awarded bursary funding in the current academic year. This may include pupils who have left the school since the start of the academic year. For dual registered pupils, the school holding the main registration for the pupil is responsible for awarding the bursary fund and return the required data.</p>
	
	<p>The 16 to 19 bursary fund is administered locally by providers and local authorities who receive their funding allocation directly from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). Whilst schools may be able to record in their systems other types of financial support awarded to these pupils, the school census only collects codes 55 and 56.</p>
	
	<p>During the academic year the circumstances of a student awarded the discretionary element may change and they could become part of a designated vulnerable group. In such circumstances the individual would also qualify for the award of the vulnerable payment (on a pro-rata basis for the academic year). For example, a student may be awarded the discretionary element in September 2019 and then the vulnerable group bursary in February 2020. In such a situation, code 56 would be returned in the spring school census and both code ‘56’ and code ‘55’ in the summer school census.</p>
	
	<p>Information about whether a student is actually in receipt of funding is not required for the school census. The purpose of the collection is to establish how many students been awarded bursary funding in the academic year.</p>
	
	<p>Each new academic year requires a new application for funding by students.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-date-of-entry-used-for-funding-1">Pupil date of entry [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="part-time-indicator-2">Part-time indicator</h3>
	
	<p>We consider a pupil full-time where they are in education for 10 sessions per week. A pupil who attends for 9 (or fewer) sessions is part-time.</p>
	
	<p>There is no link between funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours and sessions.</p>
	
	<p>For 30 hours of childcare (funded hours and extended hours), you can include a lunch break.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>A child may attend a 2 and a half hour morning and afternoon session, with an hour for lunch: 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the morning, 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the afternoon plus 5 hours for lunch = 30 hours.</p>
	
	<p>The child is full-time, based on the number of sessions (10) having attended morning and afternoon session each day for 5 days.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-boarder-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Pupil boarder indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Indicates whether a pupil is a boarder. The MIS automatically defaults the value of this field to ‘N’ - not a boarder.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupils-actual-national-curriculum-year-group-used-for-funding-2">Pupil’s actual national curriculum year group [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The year group in which the pupil is taught for the majority of their time, irrespective of their chronological age.</p>
	
	<p>Children turning 2 years old fall into the ‘E2’ year group. If they are recorded on the school’s admission register, you need to include them in your census return.</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect any younger children who fall into the ‘E1’ year group to be in receipt of education and should not be on the school’s admissions register. If you need to record children in ‘E1’ within your MIS, you should record with an enrolment status of ‘guest’ and not include them in your census.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-sen-provision-2">Pupil SEN provision</h3>
	
	<p>The Children and Families Act 2014 replaced Statements of Educational Need (SEN statements) with ‘Education, Health and Care plans’ (EHC plans).</p>
	
	<p>You should record any remaining SEN statements as EHC plans for the purpose of this data collection.</p>
	
	<p>We need data for all pupils on roll on the census day. SEN provision at the time of any exclusion will also be collected in all school census collections.</p>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-category-4">Exclusion category</h3>
	
	<p>For each exclusion, this indicates the type of exclusion:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>fixed period</li>
	<li>permanent</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-reason-4">Exclusion reason</h3>
	
	<p>Some MIS allow schools to enter more than one reason for any exclusion and so they can record a main as well as a secondary reason(s) for any exclusion. For the census, we only need the main reason.</p>

	<h3 id="exclusion-start-date-4">Exclusion start date</h3>
	
	<p>The exclusion start date reflects the date that the head teacher asked the pupil to leave the school. 
	We expect you to have completed all appeals procedures by the time of the return, so only exclusions that have been upheld will be included.</p>
	
	<h3 id="actual-number-of-sessions-excluded-from-4">Actual number of sessions excluded from</h3>
	
	<p>For each fixed period exclusion, you should record the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect.</p>
	
	<p>For fixed period exclusions, each full school day counts as 2 sessions - a half school day counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>Where a fixed period exclusion is for a lunchtime, each lunchtime for which the exclusion applies counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>You should count exclusions that go across 2 census collection periods as 1 exclusion in the first collection period.</p>
	
	<p>Exclusion sessions only cover the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school. A fixed period exclusion can be discontinuous which means that there can be days between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for the day(s) they attending the other organisation.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil is excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Monday. However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday – where no exclusion is in place. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The other provider would record the pupil’s attendance on the Wednesday separately.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>For the sessions where the school have agreed that the pupil is not attending, you should record these as ‘authorised absence’ and not record the pupil as excluded for these sessions.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded for 8 sessions starting on a Tuesday. However, the pupil already has authorised absence for Friday and Monday afternoons. This means the pupil is excluded for all sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, as well as the morning sessions on Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>You should not record exclusions sessions for the day(s) when the pupil is attending an approved educational activity.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which they are not excluded. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Wednesday, Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Days on which there is a planned school closure do not count towards an exclusion.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for 4 sessions starting on a Friday, but the school plans to be closed on the Monday for an INSET day. This means the pupil’s exclusion will include 2 sessions on the following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.</p>

	<li>BS7666 address format</li>
	<li>SAON, PAON, post town or other address item</li>
	<li>address line 1 to 5</li>

	<p>Every format requires a postcode.</p>
	
	<p>We expect schools to provide a valid home address for most of their pupils (including boarding pupils).</p>
	
	<p>You should record boarding pupils from abroad using their ‘home’ address as their residence during term time, which may be the school’s address.</p>
	
	<p>If a child has multiple addresses (where the child lives with both parents at different stages of the week) you should supply both addresses.</p>

	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-authorised-absence-4">Sessions missed due to authorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Authorised absence is an absence that has been authorised by a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes where a parent has provided a satisfactory explanation, for example, illness.</p>
	
	<p>Schools can retrospectively authorise an absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-unauthorised-absence-4">Sessions missed due to unauthorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Unauthorised absence is an absence without permission from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences; for example, arriving late for school after the register has closed.</p>
	
	<p>It does not apply to pupils of non-compulsory school age (those aged 4 years).</p>
	
	<h4 id="pupil-absence-and-attendance-codes-4">Pupil absence and attendance codes</h4>
	
	<p>This relates to authorised or unauthorised absences for the pupil. Schools will be aware of the full range of absence and attendance codes, which include values for attendance and for approved education activities, as these codes are used by schools MIS when recording pupil attendance.</p>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, schools are not obliged to use individual absence and attendance codes. If schools do not wish to use these codes, then they should just provide the total number of absences for the attendance period by recording these as sessions missed due to authorised absence. Absences recorded for 4-year-olds will not be treated as ‘authorised’ or ‘unauthorised’ and instead will be reported, and published, as overall absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="number-of-sessions-missed-4">Number of sessions missed</h3>
	
	<p>The number of sessions missed for each specified reason for absence. Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, will manually calculate the number of session missed and add to their census return.</p>

	<p>Each new academic year requires a new application for funding by students.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-date-of-entry-used-for-funding-2">Pupil date of entry [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-date-of-leaving-2">Pupil date of leaving</h3>
	
	<p>We need pupil status data for all pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>You should add pupil date of entry, date of leaving and part-time indicator for any pupils who are no longer on roll, but are included in your attendance and exclusion data.</p>
	
	<h3 id="part-time-indicator-3">Part-time indicator</h3>
	
	<p>We consider a pupil full-time where they are in education for 10 sessions per week. A pupil who attends for 9 (or fewer) sessions is part-time.</p>
	
	<p>There is no link between funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours and sessions.</p>
	
	<p>For 30 hours of childcare (funded hours and extended hours), you can include a lunch break.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>A child may attend a 2 and a half hour morning and afternoon session, with an hour for lunch: 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the morning, 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the afternoon plus 5 hours for lunch = 30 hours.</p>
	
	<p>The child is full-time, based on the number of sessions (10) having attended morning and afternoon session each day for 5 days.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="pupil-boarder-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Pupil boarder indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Indicates whether a pupil is a boarder. The MIS automatically defaults the value of this field to ‘N’ - not a boarder.</p>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-category-5">Exclusion category</h3>
	
	<p>For each exclusion, this indicates the type of exclusion:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>fixed period</li>
	<li>permanent</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-reason-5">Exclusion reason</h3>
	
	<p>Some MIS allow schools to enter more than one reason for any exclusion and so they can record a main as well as a secondary reason(s) for any exclusion. For the census, we only need the main reason.</p>

	<h3 id="exclusion-start-date-5">Exclusion start date</h3>
	
	<p>The exclusion start date reflects the date that the head teacher asked the pupil to leave the school. 
	We expect you to have completed all appeals procedures by the time of the return, so only exclusions that have been upheld will be included.</p>
	
	<h3 id="actual-number-of-sessions-excluded-from-5">Actual number of sessions excluded from</h3>
	
	<p>For each fixed period exclusion, you should record the actual number of sessions for which the exclusion is in effect.</p>
	
	<p>For fixed period exclusions, each full school day counts as 2 sessions - a half school day counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>Where a fixed period exclusion is for a lunchtime, each lunchtime for which the exclusion applies counts as 1 session.</p>
	
	<p>You should count exclusions that go across 2 census collection periods as 1 exclusion in the first collection period.</p>
	
	<p>Exclusion sessions only cover the number of sessions the pupil is expected to be at the school. A fixed period exclusion can be discontinuous which means that there can be days between the start and finish dates of the exclusion that are not included as part of the exclusion.</p>
	
	<p>Where a pupil is dually registered, exclusion sessions are not recorded for the day(s) they attending the other organisation.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil is excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Monday. However, the pupil is registered with another provider on the Wednesday – where no exclusion is in place. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. The other provider would record the pupil’s attendance on the Wednesday separately.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>For the sessions where the school have agreed that the pupil is not attending, you should record these as ‘authorised absence’ and not record the pupil as excluded for these sessions.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded for 8 sessions starting on a Tuesday. However, the pupil already has authorised absence for Friday and Monday afternoons. This means the pupil is excluded for all sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, as well as the morning sessions on Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>You should not record exclusions sessions for the day(s) when the pupil is attending an approved educational activity.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a year 10 pupil has been excluded for 6 sessions starting on a Wednesday. However, the pupil attends work experience on a Thursday from which they are not excluded. This means the pupil is excluded from the school for sessions on Wednesday, Friday and Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Days on which there is a planned school closure do not count towards an exclusion.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil has been excluded from a school for 4 sessions starting on a Friday, but the school plans to be closed on the Monday for an INSET day. This means the pupil’s exclusion will include 2 sessions on the following Tuesday, rather than the Monday.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="sen-provision-at-the-time-of-the-exclusion-4">SEN provision at the time of the exclusion</h3>
	
	<p>For each exclusion record returned, the SEN provision at the time of the exclusion must be included:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>‘E’ (education, health and care plan)</li>
	<li>‘K’ (SEN support)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-review-3">Exclusion review</h3>
	<p>You should not return information about independent review panels or initial governor reviews for fixed period exclusions.
	We will collect this data in the spring 2020 census for any reviews that took place in the autumn term.
	The exclusion review date reflects the date of the exclusion review (the date that the final outcome was decided).</p>
	
	<h3 id="exclusion-review-result-3">Exclusion review result</h3>
	
	<p>You should only return the final outcome of the exclusion review.</p>

	<h3 id="exclusion-reinstatement-date-3">Exclusion reinstatement date</h3>
	<p>The exclusion reinstatement date reflects the date the school readmitted the pupil following the exclusion review.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sen-expert-requested-3">SEN expert requested</h3>
	<p>Schools must record if a SEN expert was requested during the review as ‘Y’ if requested and ‘N’ if not requested.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-possible-5">Sessions possible</h3>
	
	<p>This records the number of sessions possible for the attendance period (term or half term). There are 2 sessions for each school day (morning and afternoon).</p>
	
	<p>Every pupil aged 4 to 15 (excluding boarders) at the previous 31 August who was on the school roll for at least one session during the specified attendance period (term or half term) should have an entry for the number of possible sessions.</p>
	
	<p>Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, manually calculate and add to their census return.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-authorised-absence-5">Sessions missed due to authorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Authorised absence is an absence that has been authorised by a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes where a parent has provided a satisfactory explanation, for example, illness.</p>
	
	<p>Schools can retrospectively authorise an absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sessions-missed-due-to-unauthorised-absence-5">Sessions missed due to unauthorised absence</h3>
	
	<p>Unauthorised absence is an absence without permission from a teacher or other authorised representative of the school. This includes all unexplained or unjustified absences; for example, arriving late for school after the register has closed.</p>
	
	<p>It does not apply to pupils of non-compulsory school age (those aged 4 years).</p>
	
	<h4 id="pupil-absence-and-attendance-codes-5">Pupil absence and attendance codes</h4>
	
	<p>This relates to authorised or unauthorised absences for the pupil. Schools will be aware of the full range of absence and attendance codes, which include values for attendance and for approved education activities, as these codes are used by schools MIS when recording pupil attendance.</p>
	
	<p>For pupils aged 4 years, schools are not obliged to use individual absence and attendance codes. If schools do not wish to use these codes, then they should just provide the total number of absences for the attendance period by recording these as sessions missed due to authorised absence. Absences recorded for 4-year-olds will not be treated as ‘authorised’ or ‘unauthorised’ and instead will be reported, and published, as overall absence.</p>
	
	<h3 id="number-of-sessions-missed-5">Number of sessions missed</h3>
	
	<p>The number of sessions missed for each specified reason for absence. Schools that use electronic registration that is not integrated with their main MIS, or record attendances in paper registers, will manually calculate the number of session missed and add to their census return.</p>
