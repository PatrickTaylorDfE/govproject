	<p>The <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> is a 13-character code that identifies each pupil in local-authority-maintained schools.</p>
	
	<p>You should not calculate it manually as the <abbr title="unique pupil number">UPN</abbr> would either be:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>pupil’s first language is not known with absolute certainty</li>

	<p>Pupil who were eligible for free school meals on 31 March 2018 or after, should continue to receive free school meals until their phase of education ends.</p>
	
	<p>This applies even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria. You should enter free school meal eligibility data in each census.</p>
	
	<p>You should not enter end dates unless:</p>

	<li>a pupil transfers from another UK country – their non-English free school meals must have an end date</li>
	<li>a parent notifies the school that their support under the Immigration &amp; Asylum Act 1999 or the pension credit has ended</li>

	<p>Where schools have free school meals eligibility flagged for a pupil in their systems they must ensure their systems include a free school meals start date ready for collection in census and transfer in common transfer files.</p>
	
	<p>You can return multiple free school meals eligibility start and end dates falling within the periods above where applicable.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil had been eligible for free school meals from 1 September until 31 October in a school in Wales and moved to a school in England and claimed eligibility from the 1 November.</p>
	
	<p>For the first period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-09-01 and ‘FSM’ eligibility end date of 2018-10-31 UK country code must be recorded as ‘WLS’</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For the second period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-11-01 and no ‘FSM’ eligibility end date, UK country code must be blank or recorded as ‘ENG’</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<p>Schools should record periods of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools-and-local-authorities">free school meals eligibility</a> for pupils where a claim has been made by them or on their behalf and either:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the relevant local authority/school has confirmed that they are entitled to free school meals</li>
	<li>the relevant local authority/school has seen the necessary documentation (that confirms entitlement to free school meals</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Any claimant who is in receipt of free school meals on or after 31 March 2018 should continue to receive free school meals until the end of the universal credit roll out period, and then until their phase of education ends. This applies until summer 2023 even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	
	<p>It is not necessary for schools / local authorities to calculate a family‘s annual taxable income. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) perform this income calculation and this figure is used to determine free school meal entitlement.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Free school meals eligibility checking service</strong></p>
	
	<p>The free school meals (FSM) eligibility checking service streamlines the FSM eligibility checking process for both local authorities and parents.</p>
	
	<p>Academies are not able to access the service directly. Some academies ask their local authority (often for a fee) to check eligibility via the eligibility checking service on their behalf. The service available, and its cost, varies between local authorities.</p>
	
	<h3 id="school-lunches-taken-used-for-funding">School lunches taken [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This data item records whether an infant pupil has taken a school lunch on census day. This may include packed lunches provided by the school to children on school trips.</p>
	
	<p>We collect this data each term from all schools and use it to allocate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-infant-free-school-meals-guide-for-schools-and-local-authorities">universal infant free school meal funding</a>.</p>

	
	<h3 id="service-children-in-education-indicator-used-for-funding">Service children in education indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We collect data to indicate all service child in education pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>You must only record this information if it has come from the parent / guardian and / or child.</p>
	
	<p>This field defaults to ‘N’ so you only need to change it for entries for children from service families.</p>
	
	<p>It is essential that you record this data item be correctly on the school census as we use this to determine the pupil premium allocations for schools.</p>
	
	<p>A ‘service child’ has parent(s) - or person(s) with parental responsibility - who is / are service personnel serving:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>in regular HM Forces military units</li>
	<li>in full commitment as part of the full-time reserve service</li>
	<li>in the armed forces of another nation and stationed in England</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Reserve units are not classed as the regular armed forces and such pupils are not recorded as service children on the school census. However, where a reserve soldier is acting in a full-time capacity, this is classified as regular service.</p>
	
	<p>The service children indicator is only relevant to children whose parents are designated as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-status-category-definitions">personal category 1 or 2</a>. All parents will be aware of their personal category.</p>
	
	<h3 id="funded-free-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding">Funded free entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours record, for eligible pupils aged two, three and four years, the total number of free entitlement to early education funded hours in education provision (following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school. This information is provided by all schools with relevant age children: with the exception of city technology colleges and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	
	<p>All children become eligible for free early education from the term following a child’s third birthday irrespective of background or family circumstances (the universal free entitlement). A specified subset of disadvantaged two year olds also become eligible from the term following a child’s second birthday. Local authorities will confirm which children meet the eligibility criteria should schools not know. Some three and four-year-olds are also eligible for up to an additional 15 hours per week – the extended free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>The table below shows the dates of birth and year groups of children for whom funded free entitlement hours are required. Where a child falls into the cohorts listed below but is not in receipt of any funding via the free entitlements, a value of zero is recorded for funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>Data collected via the spring census is used by the department to determine the early years block of the dedicated schools grant allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>Although not used centrally by the department for funding allocations, funded free entitlement hours from the autumn and summer census may be used locally by local authorities for funding early education.</p>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours contain only the hours the pupil is in education provision and following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage. Such education will follow the department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and excludes any hours where the pupils are not receiving education or any additional hours that are funded by other means (such as the parent).</p>
	
	<p>From the 2019 to 2020 financial year, all children will be capped at 15 hours for the universal entitlement as we set out in our government response to the early years national funding formula in December 2016. This is a change and will be reflected in local authority funding from 2019 to 2020.</p>

	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year in ‘reception’ and above are funded as full-time equivalent pupils via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant and therefore funded free entitlement hours are not relevant or required for those pupils, as they are not funded via the free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the funded free entitlement hours spent in education at each school. The main registration records funded hours in education at the main registration, with the subsidiary recording funded hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>It is important that the funded free entitlement hours recorded on the census accurately reflect the hours at the setting to two decimal places. It should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes. For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 20 minutes, this is recorded as 10.33 and so on</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="extended-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding">Extended entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Extended entitlement hours are collected for 3 and 4 year old children, with working parents, who are in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school.</p>
	
	<p>As with the universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours become available – where the parent has a valid 30-hour code - from the term following a child’s third birthday until they reach compulsory school age. Extended entitlement hours are available for pupils aged three and those pupils aged four who are in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ or ‘N2’ only.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who are in ‘reception’ (or above) are not eligible for extended entitlement hours, as they are in full-time education.</p>
	
	<p>As with universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours are recorded to two decimal places and it should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes.
	For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 40 minutes, this is recorded as 10.67 of extended entitlement hours per week (up to a maximum of 15 hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a child is in receipt of extended entitlement hours, the maximum funded free entitlement hours allowable is 15 hours. The extended entitlement hours field must not include any universal funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<h3 id="hour-indicator">30 hour indicator</h3>
	
	<p>The 30 hour code indicator is an 11-digit integer that is required for pupils who claim extended entitlement hours. As with the extended entitlement hours field, this applies to all 3 year olds and those pupils aged 4 in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only. The code confirms the eligibility of working parents to receive the 15 extended entitlement hours funding. This is particularly important as parents may split this entitlement between 2 providers.</p>
	
	<p>The code, once issued, remains fixed and refers to a single parent / child combination -where a parent has two children, each child will have their own code. However, when the school is presented with the code by the parent, the school must confirm the code’s validity with their local authority.</p>
	
	<p>Where a child transfers school, the local authority must be informed of the transfer.</p>
	
	<p>From September 2018, foster children are eligible for 30 hours free childcare in certain circumstances. Foster parents will not apply for the extended free entitlement through the Childcare Service due to the additional eligibility checking steps required. The 30-hour code indicator will be issued by the local authority to the foster parents. Providers will still check the code in the same way as for any other parent taking up 30 hours. It should be noted that although it will still be an 11-digit code, it will begin with a different number to HMRC issued codes. This is to allow local management of the reconfirmation process. Further information about 30 hours free childcare is available in the Department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and the Department’s early years entitlements operational guidance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="disability-access-fund-indicator-used-for-funding">Disability access fund indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The disability access fund (DAF) indicator records, for eligible pupils aged three and four, the receipt of DAF funding. Three and four-year-olds will be eligible for the DAF if they meet the following criteria:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the child is in receipt of child disability living allowance</li>
	<li>the child receives free early education (via the universal entitlement or extended childcare hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 as at the 31 August in reception and above, who are funded via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant, are not eligible for DAF funding. Further information on the DAF is available in the early years national funding formula (EYNFF) operational guidance.</p>
	
	<p>The DAF indicator should only be returned for eligible children within the date of birth range, and year groups, outlined below.</p>

	<h3 id="hours-at-setting-used-for-funding">Hours at setting [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Hours at setting are collected for the same pupils and schools for whom funded free entitlement hours are collected. This data item records for pupils aged 2, 3 and 4 years old, the total number of hours they spent in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school irrespective of who funded the hours – it is the total of:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any hours funded under the free early education entitlements</li>
	<li>plus any hours funded under extended entitlement (for working parents)</li>
	<li>plus any additional hours of education funded from other sources such as parents</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This information will allow the department to monitor the hours attended at maintained settings on the same basis as private/voluntary/independent provision.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the actual hours attending each school. The main registration records the hours in education at the main registration. The subsidiary registration records the hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>Hours at setting records the hours in education to two decimal places (that is, where a pupil has 10 and a-half-hours, for example, this is recorded as 10.50, with 10 and three-quarter hours being 10.75).</p>
	
	<h3 id="top-up-funding-indicator-used-for-funding">Top-up funding indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We are using the top-up funding indicator in the new high needs national funding formula that has been introduced to calculate high needs funding allocation from 2018 to 2019. In addition, we use this indicator for research purposes and to provide benchmarking information to local areas. As such, it is very important that all schools complete this correctly and follow the guidance provided.</p>
	
	<p>This is a true / false flag to indicate those pupils on roll for whom the school receives, on census day, top-up funding - either from a local authority or, in the case of a PRU / AP, a local authority or another school.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid outside a maintained school’s budget share or academy’s general annual grant and relates to a pupil or student identified as requiring additional support, which costs more than a specified threshold. In many cases, the period for which top-up funding is paid may not be defined but the top-up funding will - as with the <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision to which it relates - be subject to periodic review.</p>
	
	<p>Usually, but not always, the pupils for whom a primary or secondary mainstream school receives top-up funding are those with an education, health and care (EHC) plan. Sometimes local authorities may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support. Locally this top-up funding may be called by a different name: in cases of doubt, schools should check with their local authority to make sure that this is recorded correctly for each individual pupil.</p>
	
	<p>The specified cost threshold for additional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support varies according to the type of provision. For primary and secondary mainstream schools and academies, the threshold is £6,000 per pupil per annum in all cases.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid in respect of individual pupils whose additional support costs more than this, and is for the excess costs over the threshold. However, in the case of all special schools, special academies, special free schools, PRU / AP, the funding they receive is £10,000 per place, and the top-up funding will be for the costs incurred by the school in providing additional support in excess of this funding. Because the full cost of places in special schools, special academies and special free schools, PRU / AP usually exceeds £10,000, these types of schools will normally receive top-up funding for most, if not all, of the pupils in the school.</p>
	
	<h3 id="enrolment-status-used-for-funding">Enrolment status [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The pupil enrolment status - recorded within the schools management information system (MIS) using one of the registration codes. It is important that each pupil recorded within the school census be assigned a correct enrolment status. This ensures the pupil is correctly registered at a school in line with the pupil registration regulations.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils recorded as ‘guest’ should not be included in the census return.</p>
	
	<p>The MIS will automatically default the value of this field to ‘C’ - current (single registration at this school).</p>
	
	<h3 id="date-of-entry-used-for-funding">Date of entry [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="part-time-indicator">Part-time indicator</h3>
	
	<p>We consider a pupil full-time where they are in education for 10 sessions per week. A pupil who attends for 9 (or fewer) sessions is part-time.</p>
	
	<p>There is no link between funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours and sessions.</p>
	
	<p>For 30 hours of childcare (funded hours and extended hours), you can include a lunch break.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>A child may attend a 2 and a half hour morning and afternoon session, with an hour for lunch: 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the morning, 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the afternoon plus 5 hours for lunch = 30 hours.</p>

	<p>We do not expect any younger children who fall into the ‘E1’ year group to be in receipt of education and should not be on the school’s admissions register. If you need to record children in ‘E1’ within your MIS, you should record with an enrolment status of ‘guest’ and not include them in your census.</p>

	<h3 id="home-information">Home information</h3>
	
	<p>We only collect this information if the ‘pupil address type’ is ‘C’ (current).</p>
	
	<p>Schools can provide the department with their addresses in the format their MIS holds the data:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>BS7666 address format</li>
	<li>SAON, PAON, post town or other address item</li>
	<li>address line 1 to 5</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Every format requires a postcode.</p>
	
	<p>We expect schools to provide a valid home address for most of their pupils (including boarding pupils).</p>
	
	<p>You should record boarding pupils from abroad using their ‘home’ address as their residence during term time, which may be the school’s address.</p>
	
	<p>If a child has multiple addresses (where the child lives with both parents at different stages of the week) you should supply both addresses.</p>
	
	<p>If it is possible to get the address, you should leave these fields blank or add a partial address and ignore the validation errors.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unique-property-reference-number">Unique property reference number</h3>
	
	<p>A unique property reference number (UPRN) is a unique integer identifier for every address in Great Britain.</p>
	
	<p>The UPRN is a voluntary data item which you may choose to return alongside the full address (in either BS7666 or address line structure).</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect schools to collect, or look up, the UPRN and instead this will be automatically populated within your school system when entering addresses if the OS AddressBase database is used as a reference.</p>

	<p>Where schools have free school meals eligibility flagged for a pupil in their systems they must ensure their systems include a free school meals start date ready for collection in census and transfer in common transfer files.</p>
	
	<p>You can return multiple free school meals eligibility start and end dates falling within the periods above where applicable.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil had been eligible for free school meals from 1 September until 31 October in a school in Wales and moved to a school in England and claimed eligibility from the 1 November.</p>
	
	<p>For the first period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-09-01 and ‘FSM’ eligibility end date of 2018-10-31 UK country code must be recorded as ‘WLS’</li>

	<p>For the second period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-11-01 and no ‘FSM’ eligibility end date, UK country code must be blank or recorded as ‘ENG’</li>

	<p>Schools should record periods of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools-and-local-authorities">free school meals eligibility</a> for pupils where a claim has been made by them or on their behalf and either:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the relevant local authority/school has confirmed that they are entitled to free school meals</li>
	<li>the relevant local authority/school has seen the necessary documentation (that confirms entitlement to free school meals</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Any claimant who is in receipt of free school meals on or after 31 March 2018 should continue to receive free school meals until the end of the universal credit roll out period, and then until their phase of education ends. This applies until summer 2023 even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	
	<p>It is not necessary for schools / local authorities to calculate a family‘s annual taxable income. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) perform this income calculation and this figure is used to determine free school meal entitlement.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Free school meals eligibility checking service</strong></p>
	
	<p>The free school meals (FSM) eligibility checking service streamlines the FSM eligibility checking process for both local authorities and parents.</p>
	
	<p>Academies are not able to access the service directly. Some academies ask their local authority (often for a fee) to check eligibility via the eligibility checking service on their behalf. The service available, and its cost, varies between local authorities.</p>
	
	<h3 id="school-lunches-taken-used-for-funding-1">School lunches taken [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This data item records whether an infant pupil has taken a school lunch on census day. This may include packed lunches provided by the school to children on school trips.</p>
	
	<p>We collect this data each term from all schools and use it to allocate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-infant-free-school-meals-guide-for-schools-and-local-authorities">universal infant free school meal funding</a>.</p>

	
	<h3 id="service-children-in-education-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Service children in education indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We collect data to indicate all service child in education pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>You must only record this information if it has come from the parent / guardian and / or child.</p>
	
	<p>This field defaults to ‘N’ so you only need to change it for entries for children from service families.</p>
	
	<p>It is essential that you record this data item be correctly on the school census as we use this to determine the pupil premium allocations for schools.</p>
	
	<p>A ‘service child’ has parent(s) - or person(s) with parental responsibility - who is / are service personnel serving:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>in regular HM Forces military units</li>
	<li>in full commitment as part of the full-time reserve service</li>
	<li>in the armed forces of another nation and stationed in England</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Reserve units are not classed as the regular armed forces and such pupils are not recorded as service children on the school census. However, where a reserve soldier is acting in a full-time capacity, this is classified as regular service.</p>
	
	<p>The service children indicator is only relevant to children whose parents are designated as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-status-category-definitions">personal category 1 or 2</a>. All parents will be aware of their personal category.</p>
	
	<h3 id="funded-free-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding-1">Funded free entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours record, for eligible pupils aged two, three and four years, the total number of free entitlement to early education funded hours in education provision (following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school. This information is provided by all schools with relevant age children: with the exception of city technology colleges and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	
	<p>All children become eligible for free early education from the term following a child’s third birthday irrespective of background or family circumstances (the universal free entitlement). A specified subset of disadvantaged two year olds also become eligible from the term following a child’s second birthday. Local authorities will confirm which children meet the eligibility criteria should schools not know. Some three and four-year-olds are also eligible for up to an additional 15 hours per week – the extended free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>The table below shows the dates of birth and year groups of children for whom funded free entitlement hours are required. Where a child falls into the cohorts listed below but is not in receipt of any funding via the free entitlements, a value of zero is recorded for funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>Data collected via the spring census is used by the department to determine the early years block of the dedicated schools grant allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>Although not used centrally by the department for funding allocations, funded free entitlement hours from the autumn and summer census may be used locally by local authorities for funding early education.</p>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours contain only the hours the pupil is in education provision and following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage. Such education will follow the department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and excludes any hours where the pupils are not receiving education or any additional hours that are funded by other means (such as the parent).</p>
	
	<p>From the 2019 to 2020 financial year, all children will be capped at 15 hours for the universal entitlement as we set out in our government response to the early years national funding formula in December 2016. This is a change and will be reflected in local authority funding from 2019 to 2020.</p>

	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year in ‘reception’ and above are funded as full-time equivalent pupils via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant and therefore funded free entitlement hours are not relevant or required for those pupils, as they are not funded via the free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the funded free entitlement hours spent in education at each school. The main registration records funded hours in education at the main registration, with the subsidiary recording funded hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>It is important that the funded free entitlement hours recorded on the census accurately reflect the hours at the setting to two decimal places. It should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes. For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 20 minutes, this is recorded as 10.33 and so on</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="extended-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding-1">Extended entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Extended entitlement hours are collected for 3 and 4 year old children, with working parents, who are in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school.</p>
	
	<p>As with the universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours become available – where the parent has a valid 30-hour code - from the term following a child’s third birthday until they reach compulsory school age. Extended entitlement hours are available for pupils aged three and those pupils aged four who are in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ or ‘N2’ only.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who are in ‘reception’ (or above) are not eligible for extended entitlement hours, as they are in full-time education.</p>
	
	<p>As with universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours are recorded to two decimal places and it should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes.
	For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 40 minutes, this is recorded as 10.67 of extended entitlement hours per week (up to a maximum of 15 hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a child is in receipt of extended entitlement hours, the maximum funded free entitlement hours allowable is 15 hours. The extended entitlement hours field must not include any universal funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<h3 id="hour-indicator-1">30 hour indicator</h3>
	
	<p>The 30 hour code indicator is an 11-digit integer that is required for pupils who claim extended entitlement hours. As with the extended entitlement hours field, this applies to all 3 year olds and those pupils aged 4 in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only. The code confirms the eligibility of working parents to receive the 15 extended entitlement hours funding. This is particularly important as parents may split this entitlement between 2 providers.</p>
	
	<p>The code, once issued, remains fixed and refers to a single parent / child combination -where a parent has two children, each child will have their own code. However, when the school is presented with the code by the parent, the school must confirm the code’s validity with their local authority.</p>
	
	<p>Where a child transfers school, the local authority must be informed of the transfer.</p>
	
	<p>From September 2018, foster children are eligible for 30 hours free childcare in certain circumstances. Foster parents will not apply for the extended free entitlement through the Childcare Service due to the additional eligibility checking steps required. The 30-hour code indicator will be issued by the local authority to the foster parents. Providers will still check the code in the same way as for any other parent taking up 30 hours. It should be noted that although it will still be an 11-digit code, it will begin with a different number to HMRC issued codes. This is to allow local management of the reconfirmation process. Further information about 30 hours free childcare is available in the Department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and the Department’s early years entitlements operational guidance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="disability-access-fund-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Disability access fund indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The disability access fund (DAF) indicator records, for eligible pupils aged three and four, the receipt of DAF funding. Three and four-year-olds will be eligible for the DAF if they meet the following criteria:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the child is in receipt of child disability living allowance</li>
	<li>the child receives free early education (via the universal entitlement or extended childcare hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 as at the 31 August in reception and above, who are funded via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant, are not eligible for DAF funding. Further information on the DAF is available in the early years national funding formula (EYNFF) operational guidance.</p>
	
	<p>The DAF indicator should only be returned for eligible children within the date of birth range, and year groups, outlined below.</p>

	<p>Hours at setting are collected for the same pupils and schools for whom funded free entitlement hours are collected. This data item records for pupils aged 2, 3 and 4 years old, the total number of hours they spent in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school irrespective of who funded the hours – it is the total of:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any hours funded under the free early education entitlements</li>
	<li>plus any hours funded under extended entitlement (for working parents)</li>
	<li>plus any additional hours of education funded from other sources such as parents</li>

	<p>This information will allow the department to monitor the hours attended at maintained settings on the same basis as private/voluntary/independent provision.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the actual hours attending each school. The main registration records the hours in education at the main registration. The subsidiary registration records the hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>Hours at setting records the hours in education to two decimal places (that is, where a pupil has 10 and a-half-hours, for example, this is recorded as 10.50, with 10 and three-quarter hours being 10.75).</p>

	<h3 id="early-years-pupil-premium-used-for-funding">Early years pupil premium [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The early years pupil premium (EYPP) is additional funding for early years settings to improve the education they provide for disadvantaged 3 and 4 year olds (all 3 and 4 year olds are entitled to up to 15 hours per week of government funded free entitlement early education for 38 weeks of the year).</p>
	
	<p>Provided that they are taking the universal 15 hours free entitlement and meet the eligibility criteria, children become eligible to receive early years pupil premium from the term following a child’s third birthday and retain this entitlement until they move into ‘reception’, when they become eligible to receive the ‘mainstream’ pupil premium.</p>
	
	<p>Only children in receipt of EYPP in census week should be recorded with early years pupil premium receipt equal to ‘true’.</p>
	
	<p>EYPP is paid by local authorities direct to settings. Its award is dependent on the application by parents of eligible children to their local authority, which will use the eligibility checking service to verify their application against benefits related data.</p>
	
	<p>Children are eligible to receive EYPP if they receive the universal 15 hours entitlement and either:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>meet benefits related criteria equivalent to those for free school meals (please note: meals provided as part of the universal entitlement are not FSM; receipt of FSM does not automatically qualify a child for EYPP)</li>
	<li>are in the care of the local authority (in England or Wales)</li>
	<li>have left care (in England or Wales) through:
	<ul>
	<li>adoption</li>
	<li>special guardianship</li>
	<li>a child arrangements order (formerly known as a residence order)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This data, collected via the spring census, will be used by the department to determine the early years pupil premium allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>In the spring census, we need early years pupil premium data for:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>all 3 year olds - irrespective of school type and year group</li>
	<li>4 year olds at nursery schools (phase equals ‘NS’) – all year groups</li>
	<li>4 year olds at all schools other than nurseries (phase does not equal ‘NS’) – pupil national curriculum year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year, in reception are eligible to receive the school age pupil premium so are not eligible to receive early years pupil premium funding.</p>
	
	<h3 id="top-up-funding-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Top-up funding indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We are using the top-up funding indicator in the new high needs national funding formula that has been introduced to calculate high needs funding allocation from 2018 to 2019. In addition, we use this indicator for research purposes and to provide benchmarking information to local areas. As such, it is very important that all schools complete this correctly and follow the guidance provided.</p>
	
	<p>This is a true / false flag to indicate those pupils on roll for whom the school receives, on census day, top-up funding - either from a local authority or, in the case of a PRU / AP, a local authority or another school.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid outside a maintained school’s budget share or academy’s general annual grant and relates to a pupil or student identified as requiring additional support, which costs more than a specified threshold. In many cases, the period for which top-up funding is paid may not be defined but the top-up funding will - as with the <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision to which it relates - be subject to periodic review.</p>
	
	<p>Usually, but not always, the pupils for whom a primary or secondary mainstream school receives top-up funding are those with an education, health and care (EHC) plan. Sometimes local authorities may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support. Locally this top-up funding may be called by a different name: in cases of doubt, schools should check with their local authority to make sure that this is recorded correctly for each individual pupil.</p>
	
	<p>The specified cost threshold for additional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support varies according to the type of provision. For primary and secondary mainstream schools and academies, the threshold is £6,000 per pupil per annum in all cases.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid in respect of individual pupils whose additional support costs more than this, and is for the excess costs over the threshold. However, in the case of all special schools, special academies, special free schools, PRU / AP, the funding they receive is £10,000 per place, and the top-up funding will be for the costs incurred by the school in providing additional support in excess of this funding. Because the full cost of places in special schools, special academies and special free schools, PRU / AP usually exceeds £10,000, these types of schools will normally receive top-up funding for most, if not all, of the pupils in the school.</p>
	
	<h3 id="enrolment-status-used-for-funding-1">Enrolment status [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The pupil enrolment status - recorded within the schools management information system (MIS) using one of the registration codes. It is important that each pupil recorded within the school census be assigned a correct enrolment status. This ensures the pupil is correctly registered at a school in line with the pupil registration regulations.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils recorded as ‘guest’ should not be included in the census return.</p>
	
	<p>The MIS will automatically default the value of this field to ‘C’ - current (single registration at this school).</p>
	
	<h3 id="date-of-entry-used-for-funding-1">Date of entry [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="part-time-indicator-1">Part-time indicator</h3>
	
	<p>We consider a pupil full-time where they are in education for 10 sessions per week. A pupil who attends for 9 (or fewer) sessions is part-time.</p>
	
	<p>There is no link between funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours and sessions.</p>
	
	<p>For 30 hours of childcare (funded hours and extended hours), you can include a lunch break.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>A child may attend a 2 and a half hour morning and afternoon session, with an hour for lunch: 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the morning, 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the afternoon plus 5 hours for lunch = 30 hours.</p>
	
	<p>The child is full-time, based on the number of sessions (10) having attended morning and afternoon session each day for 5 days.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="boarder-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Boarder indicator [used for funding]</h3>

	<h3 id="actual-national-curriculum-year-group-used-for-funding-1">Actual national curriculum year group [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The year group in which the pupil is taught for the majority of their time, irrespective of their chronological age.</p>
	
	<p>Children turning 2 years old fall into the ‘E2’ year group. If they are recorded on the school’s admission register, you need to include them in your census return.</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect any younger children who fall into the ‘E1’ year group to be in receipt of education and should not be on the school’s admissions register. If you need to record children in ‘E1’ within your MIS, you should record with an enrolment status of ‘guest’ and not include them in your census.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sen-provision-1">

	<p>The Children and Families Act 2014 replaced Statements of Educational Need (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> statements) with ‘Education, Health and Care plans’ (EHC plans).</p>
	
	<p>You should record any remaining <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> statements as EHC plans for the purpose of this data collection.</p>
	
	<p>We need data for all pupils on roll on the census day. <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision at the time of any exclusion will also be collected in all school census collections.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sen-type-ranking">
	<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> type ranking</h3>
	
	<p>This indicates the ranking of a pupil’s special educational need, as recorded in pupil <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> type. The most significant, or primary need, is ranked as ‘1’ with any secondary need ranked ‘2’. Only 2 rankings are collected in the school census, if there is more than one <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> type reported they cannot both have a ranking of ‘1’.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sen-type">
	<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> type</h3>
	
	<p>This field records the nature (type) of a pupil’s special educational need. We collect this data in the spring census for all pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>Schools need to add a type of need for all pupils they are identifying as having special educational needs in the return.</p>
	
	<p>You should only use the NSA code (‘NSA’) where a pupil is placed on <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support (code ‘K’), but the school is still assessing what the primary need is.</p>
	
	<h3 id="member-of-sen-unit-sometimes-called-special-class-used-for-funding-1">Member of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> unit (sometimes called special class) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This field identifies pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> who are members of an <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> unit. <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> units are special provisions within a mainstream school where the pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> are taught mainly within separate classes.</p>
	
	<p>Units:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>are designated by the local authority specifically for making <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision, and sometimes accommodate pupils registered at other schools on a part-time basis</li>
	<li>receive funding of £6,000 or £10,000 per place, and usually top-up funding for the excess costs of additional support required by individual pupils</li>
	<li>cater for a specific type or types of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> (for example autistic spectrum disorders)</li>
	<li>are usually for pupils with an education, health and care (EHC) plan (but may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Schools and academies should only use this indicator where the <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> unit has been formally recognised as such by the local authority where the school is located.</p>
	
	<h3 id="member-of-resourced-provision-indicator-used-for-funding-1">Member of resourced provision indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This field identifies pupils who receive support for their type of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> from a specialist-resourced provision.</p>
	
	<p>Resourced provisions are places that are reserved at a mainstream school for pupils with a specific type of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>, taught mainly within mainstream classes, but requiring a base and some specialist facilities around the school.</p>
	
	<p>Resourced provisions:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>are designated by the local authority specifically for making this kind of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision</li>
	<li>receive funding of £6,000 or £10,000 per place, and usually top-up funding for the excess costs of additional support required by individual pupils</li>
	<li>cater for a specific area or areas of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> (for example specific learning difficulties)</li>
	<li>are usually for pupils with an education, health and care (EHC) plan - but could include pupils with code ‘K’ (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support)</li>

	<ul>
	<li>BS7666 address format</li>
	<li>SAON, PAON, post town or other address item</li>
	<li>address line 1 to 5</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Every format requires a postcode.</p>
	
	<p>We expect schools to provide a valid home address for most of their pupils (including boarding pupils).</p>
	
	<p>You should record boarding pupils from abroad using their ‘home’ address as their residence during term time, which may be the school’s address.</p>
	
	<p>If a child has multiple addresses (where the child lives with both parents at different stages of the week) you should supply both addresses.</p>
	
	<p>If it is possible to get the address, you should leave these fields blank or add a partial address and ignore the validation errors.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unique-property-reference-number-1">Unique property reference number</h3>
	
	<p>A unique property reference number (UPRN) is a unique integer identifier for every address in Great Britain.</p>
	
	<p>The UPRN is a voluntary data item which you may choose to return alongside the full address (in either BS7666 or address line structure).</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect schools to collect, or look up, the UPRN and instead this will be automatically populated within your school system when entering addresses if the OS AddressBase database is used as a reference.</p>

	<p>Where schools have free school meals eligibility flagged for a pupil in their systems they must ensure their systems include a free school meals start date ready for collection in census and transfer in common transfer files.</p>
	
	<p>You can return multiple free school meals eligibility start and end dates falling within the periods above where applicable.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, a pupil had been eligible for free school meals from 1 September until 31 October in a school in Wales and moved to a school in England and claimed eligibility from the 1 November.</p>
	
	<p>For the first period of eligibility enter:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-09-01 and ‘FSM’ eligibility end date of 2018-10-31 UK country code must be recorded as ‘WLS’</li>

	<li>free school meal eligibility start date of 2018-11-01 and no ‘FSM’ eligibility end date, UK country code must be blank or recorded as ‘ENG’</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Schools should record periods of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools-and-local-authorities">free school meals eligibility</a> for pupils where a claim has been made by them or on their behalf and either:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the relevant local authority/school has confirmed that they are entitled to free school meals</li>
	<li>the relevant local authority/school has seen the necessary documentation (that confirms entitlement to free school meals</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Any claimant who is in receipt of free school meals on or after 31 March 2018 should continue to receive free school meals until the end of the universal credit roll out period, and then until their phase of education ends. This applies until summer 2023 even if their circumstances change and they would no longer meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	
	<p>It is not necessary for schools / local authorities to calculate a family‘s annual taxable income. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) perform this income calculation and this figure is used to determine free school meal entitlement.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Free school meals eligibility checking service</strong></p>
	
	<p>The free school meals (FSM) eligibility checking service streamlines the FSM eligibility checking process for both local authorities and parents.</p>
	
	<p>Academies are not able to access the service directly. Some academies ask their local authority (often for a fee) to check eligibility via the eligibility checking service on their behalf. The service available, and its cost, varies between local authorities.</p>
	
	<h3 id="school-lunches-taken-used-for-funding-2">School lunches taken [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This data item records whether an infant pupil has taken a school lunch on census day. This may include packed lunches provided by the school to children on school trips.</p>
	
	<p>We collect this data each term from all schools and use it to allocate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-infant-free-school-meals-guide-for-schools-and-local-authorities">universal infant free school meal funding</a>.</p>

	
	<h3 id="service-children-in-education-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Service children in education indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We collect data to indicate all service child in education pupils on roll on census day.</p>
	
	<p>You must only record this information if it has come from the parent / guardian and / or child.</p>
	
	<p>This field defaults to ‘N’ so you only need to change it for entries for children from service families.</p>
	
	<p>It is essential that you record this data item be correctly on the school census as we use this to determine the pupil premium allocations for schools.</p>
	
	<p>A ‘service child’ has parent(s) - or person(s) with parental responsibility - who is / are service personnel serving:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>in regular HM Forces military units</li>
	<li>in full commitment as part of the full-time reserve service</li>
	<li>in the armed forces of another nation and stationed in England</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Reserve units are not classed as the regular armed forces and such pupils are not recorded as service children on the school census. However, where a reserve soldier is acting in a full-time capacity, this is classified as regular service.</p>
	
	<p>The service children indicator is only relevant to children whose parents are designated as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-status-category-definitions">personal category 1 or 2</a>. All parents will be aware of their personal category.</p>
	
	<h3 id="funded-free-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding-2">Funded free entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours record, for eligible pupils aged two, three and four years, the total number of free entitlement to early education funded hours in education provision (following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school. This information is provided by all schools with relevant age children: with the exception of city technology colleges and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	
	<p>All children become eligible for free early education from the term following a child’s third birthday irrespective of background or family circumstances (the universal free entitlement). A specified subset of disadvantaged two year olds also become eligible from the term following a child’s second birthday. Local authorities will confirm which children meet the eligibility criteria should schools not know. Some three and four-year-olds are also eligible for up to an additional 15 hours per week – the extended free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>The table below shows the dates of birth and year groups of children for whom funded free entitlement hours are required. Where a child falls into the cohorts listed below but is not in receipt of any funding via the free entitlements, a value of zero is recorded for funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<p>Data collected via the spring census is used by the department to determine the early years block of the dedicated schools grant allocation that the department provides to local authorities to fund their early years providers.</p>
	
	<p>Although not used centrally by the department for funding allocations, funded free entitlement hours from the autumn and summer census may be used locally by local authorities for funding early education.</p>
	
	<p>Funded free entitlement hours contain only the hours the pupil is in education provision and following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage. Such education will follow the department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and excludes any hours where the pupils are not receiving education or any additional hours that are funded by other means (such as the parent).</p>
	
	<p>From the 2019 to 2020 financial year, all children will be capped at 15 hours for the universal entitlement as we set out in our government response to the early years national funding formula in December 2016. This is a change and will be reflected in local authority funding from 2019 to 2020.</p>

	<p>Pupils aged 4 at the start of the academic year in ‘reception’ and above are funded as full-time equivalent pupils via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant and therefore funded free entitlement hours are not relevant or required for those pupils, as they are not funded via the free entitlement.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the funded free entitlement hours spent in education at each school. The main registration records funded hours in education at the main registration, with the subsidiary recording funded hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>It is important that the funded free entitlement hours recorded on the census accurately reflect the hours at the setting to two decimal places. It should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes. For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 20 minutes, this is recorded as 10.33 and so on</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="extended-entitlement-hours-used-for-funding-2">Extended entitlement hours [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Extended entitlement hours are collected for 3 and 4 year old children, with working parents, who are in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school.</p>
	
	<p>As with the universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours become available – where the parent has a valid 30-hour code - from the term following a child’s third birthday until they reach compulsory school age. Extended entitlement hours are available for pupils aged three and those pupils aged four who are in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ or ‘N2’ only.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who are in ‘reception’ (or above) are not eligible for extended entitlement hours, as they are in full-time education.</p>
	
	<p>As with universal funded free entitlement hours, extended entitlement hours are recorded to two decimal places and it should be noted that this is a decimal of hours and therefore does not record hours and minutes.
	For example, where a pupil has:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>10 and a half hours, this is recorded as 10.50</li>
	<li>10 hours and 40 minutes, this is recorded as 10.67 of extended entitlement hours per week (up to a maximum of 15 hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Where a child is in receipt of extended entitlement hours, the maximum funded free entitlement hours allowable is 15 hours. The extended entitlement hours field must not include any universal funded free entitlement hours.</p>
	
	<h3 id="hour-indicator-2">30 hour indicator</h3>
	
	<p>The 30 hour code indicator is an 11-digit integer that is required for pupils who claim extended entitlement hours. As with the extended entitlement hours field, this applies to all 3 year olds and those pupils aged 4 in year groups ‘E1’, ‘E2’, ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ only. The code confirms the eligibility of working parents to receive the 15 extended entitlement hours funding. This is particularly important as parents may split this entitlement between 2 providers.</p>
	
	<p>The code, once issued, remains fixed and refers to a single parent / child combination -where a parent has two children, each child will have their own code. However, when the school is presented with the code by the parent, the school must confirm the code’s validity with their local authority.</p>
	
	<p>Where a child transfers school, the local authority must be informed of the transfer.</p>
	
	<p>From September 2018, foster children are eligible for 30 hours free childcare in certain circumstances. Foster parents will not apply for the extended free entitlement through the Childcare Service due to the additional eligibility checking steps required. The 30-hour code indicator will be issued by the local authority to the foster parents. Providers will still check the code in the same way as for any other parent taking up 30 hours. It should be noted that although it will still be an 11-digit code, it will begin with a different number to HMRC issued codes. This is to allow local management of the reconfirmation process. Further information about 30 hours free childcare is available in the Department’s statutory guidance for local authorities on early education and childcare and the Department’s early years entitlements operational guidance.</p>
	
	<h3 id="disability-access-fund-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Disability access fund indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The disability access fund (DAF) indicator records, for eligible pupils aged three and four, the receipt of DAF funding. Three and four-year-olds will be eligible for the DAF if they meet the following criteria:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>the child is in receipt of child disability living allowance</li>
	<li>the child receives free early education (via the universal entitlement or extended childcare hours)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Pupils aged 4 as at the 31 August in reception and above, who are funded via the schools block of the dedicated schools grant, are not eligible for DAF funding. Further information on the DAF is available in the early years national funding formula (EYNFF) operational guidance.</p>
	
	<p>The DAF indicator should only be returned for eligible children within the date of birth range, and year groups, outlined below.</p>

	<h3 id="hours-at-setting-used-for-funding-2">Hours at setting [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Hours at setting are collected for the same pupils and schools for whom funded free entitlement hours are collected. This data item records for pupils aged 2, 3 and 4 years old, the total number of hours they spent in education provision (that is, following the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage) at the school irrespective of who funded the hours – it is the total of:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>any hours funded under the free early education entitlements</li>
	<li>plus any hours funded under extended entitlement (for working parents)</li>
	<li>plus any additional hours of education funded from other sources such as parents</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This information will allow the department to monitor the hours attended at maintained settings on the same basis as private/voluntary/independent provision.</p>
	
	<p>For dually registered pupils, record the actual hours attending each school. The main registration records the hours in education at the main registration. The subsidiary registration records the hours in education at the subsidiary registration.</p>
	
	<p>Hours at setting records the hours in education to two decimal places (that is, where a pupil has 10 and a-half-hours, for example, this is recorded as 10.50, with 10 and three-quarter hours being 10.75).</p>
	
	<h3 id="top-up-funding-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Top-up funding indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>We are using the top-up funding indicator in the new high needs national funding formula that has been introduced to calculate high needs funding allocation from 2018 to 2019. In addition, we use this indicator for research purposes and to provide benchmarking information to local areas. As such, it is very important that all schools complete this correctly and follow the guidance provided.</p>
	
	<p>This is a true/false flag to indicate those pupils on roll for whom the school receives, on census day, top-up funding - either from a local authority or, in the case of a PRU / AP, a local authority or another school.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid outside a maintained school’s budget share or academy’s general annual grant and relates to a pupil or student identified as requiring additional support, which costs more than a specified threshold. In many cases, the period for which top-up funding is paid may not be defined but the top-up funding will - as with the <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision to which it relates - be subject to periodic review.</p>
	
	<p>Usually, but not always, the pupils for whom a primary or secondary mainstream school receives top-up funding are those with an education, health and care (EHC) plan. Sometimes local authorities may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support. Locally this top-up funding may be called by a different name: in cases of doubt, schools should check with their local authority to make sure that this is recorded correctly for each individual pupil.</p>
	
	<p>The specified cost threshold for additional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support varies according to the type of provision. For primary and secondary mainstream schools and academies, the threshold is £6,000 per pupil per annum in all cases.</p>
	
	<p>Top-up funding is paid in respect of individual pupils whose additional support costs more than this, and is for the excess costs over the threshold. However, in the case of all special schools, special academies, special free schools, PRU / AP, the funding they receive is £10,000 per place, and the top-up funding will be for the costs incurred by the school in providing additional support in excess of this funding. Because the full cost of places in special schools, special academies and special free schools, PRU / AP usually exceeds £10,000, these types of schools will normally receive top-up funding for most, if not all, of the pupils in the school.</p>
	
	<h3 id="enrolment-status-used-for-funding-2">Enrolment status [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The pupil enrolment status - recorded within the schools management information system (MIS) using one of the registration codes. It is important that each pupil recorded within the school census be assigned a correct enrolment status. This ensures the pupil is correctly registered at a school in line with the pupil registration regulations.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils recorded as ‘guest’ should not be included in the census return.</p>
	
	<p>The MIS will automatically default the value of this field to ‘C’ - current (single registration at this school).</p>
	
	<h3 id="date-of-entry-used-for-funding-2">Date of entry [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This is the latest date of entry to the current school.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils who transfer from nursery to reception in the same school are not given new entry dates.</p>
	
	<p>Pupils entering year 12 and above from the same school are NOT removed from the admissions register and are not given a new entry date.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school replaces an existing school and retains the existing establishment number of the predecessor school, information is returned as if they were a continuing school (they return historic data for the preceding term(s) before conversion). Where this occurs, the date of arrival in school (the entry date) for pupils remain the date at which the pupil joined the original establishment.</p>
	
	<p>Where a new school has been formed as a result of a merger - and the establishment number from one of the predecessor schools has been retained - then historic attendance and exclusion data is only returned for those pupils who attended the predecessor school for which the establishment number has been retained.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>For example, if the merger was a junior and an infant school and the newly merged school retains the establishment number of the junior school then only those pupils who previously attended the junior school are required to return the attendance and exclusion data from the previous term(s). All the pupils from the predecessor infant school must be provided with a new entry date.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Where a new school opens with a new establishment number all pupils are given a new entry date (the day that they start at the new school) and consequently any historical exclusions and attendance data from predecessor school is not returned for the new establishment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="date-of-leaving">Date of leaving</h3>
	
	<p>You should add pupil date of entry, date of leaving and part-time indicator for any pupils who are no longer on roll, but are included in your attendance and exclusion data.</p>
	
	<h3 id="part-time-indicator-2">Part-time indicator</h3>
	
	<p>We consider a pupil full-time where they are in education for 10 sessions per week. A pupil who attends for 9 (or fewer) sessions is part-time.</p>
	
	<p>There is no link between funded free entitlement / extended free entitlement hours and sessions.</p>
	
	<p>For 30 hours of childcare (funded hours and extended hours), you can include a lunch break.</p>
	
	<div class="example">
	<p>A child may attend a 2 and a half hour morning and afternoon session, with an hour for lunch: 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the morning, 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 in the afternoon plus 5 hours for lunch = 30 hours.</p>
	
	<p>The child is full-time, based on the number of sessions (10) having attended morning and afternoon session each day for 5 days.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3 id="boarder-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Boarder indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>Indicates whether a pupil is a boarder. The MIS automatically defaults the value of this field to ‘N’ - not a boarder.</p>
	
	<h3 id="actual-national-curriculum-year-group-used-for-funding-2">Actual national curriculum year group [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>The year group in which the pupil is taught for the majority of their time, irrespective of their chronological age.</p>
	
	<p>Children turning 2 years old fall into the ‘E2’ year group. If they are recorded on the school’s admission register, you need to include them in your census return.</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect any younger children who fall into the ‘E1’ year group to be in receipt of education and should not be on the school’s admissions register. If you need to record children in ‘E1’ within your MIS, you should record with an enrolment status of ‘guest’ and not include them in your census.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sen-provision-2">
	<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision</h3>
	
	<p>The Children and Families Act 2014 replaced Statements of Educational Need (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> statements) with ‘Education, Health and Care plans’ (EHC plans).</p>
	
	<p>You should record any remaining <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> statements as EHC plans for the purpose of this data collection.</p>
	
	<p>We need data for all pupils on roll on the census day. <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision at the time of any exclusion will also be collected in all school census collections.</p>
	
	<h3 id="member-of-sen-unit-sometimes-called-special-class-used-for-funding-2">Member of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> unit (sometimes called special class) [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This field identifies pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> who are members of an <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> unit. <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> units are special provisions within a mainstream school where the pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> are taught mainly within separate classes.</p>
	
	<p>Units:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>are designated by the local authority specifically for making <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision, and sometimes accommodate pupils registered at other schools on a part-time basis</li>
	<li>receive funding of £6,000 or £10,000 per place, and usually top-up funding for the excess costs of additional support required by individual pupils</li>
	<li>cater for a specific type or types of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> (for example autistic spectrum disorders)</li>
	<li>are usually for pupils with an education, health and care (EHC) plan (but may also provide support for pupils with code ‘K’ - <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Schools and academies should only use this indicator where the <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> unit has been formally recognised as such by the local authority where the school is located.</p>
	
	<h3 id="member-of-resourced-provision-indicator-used-for-funding-2">Member of resourced provision indicator [used for funding]</h3>
	
	<p>This field identifies pupils who receive support for their type of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> from a specialist-resourced provision.</p>
	
	<p>Resourced provisions are places that are reserved at a mainstream school for pupils with a specific type of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>, taught mainly within mainstream classes, but requiring a base and some specialist facilities around the school.</p>
	
	<p>Resourced provisions:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>are designated by the local authority specifically for making this kind of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> provision</li>
	<li>receive funding of £6,000 or £10,000 per place, and usually top-up funding for the excess costs of additional support required by individual pupils</li>
	<li>cater for a specific area or areas of <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> (for example specific learning difficulties)</li>
	<li>are usually for pupils with an education, health and care (EHC) plan - but could include pupils with code ‘K’ (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Schools and academies should only use this indicator where the resourced provision has been formally recognised as such by the local authority where the school is located.</p>
	
	<h3 id="home-information-2">Home information</h3>
	
	<p>We only collect this information if the ‘pupil address type’ is ‘C’ (current).</p>
	
	<p>Schools can provide the department with their addresses in the format their MIS holds the data:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>BS7666 address format</li>
	<li>SAON, PAON, post town or other address item</li>
	<li>address line 1 to 5</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Every format requires a postcode.</p>
	
	<p>We expect schools to provide a valid home address for most of their pupils (including boarding pupils).</p>
	
	<p>You should record boarding pupils from abroad using their ‘home’ address as their residence during term time, which may be the school’s address.</p>
	
	<p>If a child has multiple addresses (where the child lives with both parents at different stages of the week) you should supply both addresses.</p>
	
	<p>If it is possible to get the address, you should leave these fields blank or add a partial address and ignore the validation errors.</p>
	
	<h3 id="unique-property-reference-number-2">Unique property reference number</h3>
	
	<p>A unique property reference number (UPRN) is a unique integer identifier for every address in Great Britain.</p>
	
	<p>The UPRN is a voluntary data item which you may choose to return alongside the full address (in either BS7666 or address line structure).</p>
	
	<p>We do not expect schools to collect, or look up, the UPRN and instead this will be automatically populated within your school system when entering addresses if the OS AddressBase database is used as a reference.</p>
